## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you must have a basic understanding of the rudimentary principles of React. [React Docs](https://reactjs.org/) is a great way to start learning react.

## Getting Started

We will be using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling you can refer to their docs [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).

I have created a Starter-Template which is based on [CRA + Tailwind Guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app#install-and-configure-craco). You can clone it with the follwing script.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-zoom-clone-react zoom-clone
```

<Text id='1' toc='Creating Account'>

## Create account on 100ms

Create an account at [Dashboard of 100ms](https://dashboard.100ms.live/)

After you have created your account you have to Confirm your Email , check the promotions tab in your Mail Box if you can't find it.

Then login again and you would see this Section. Fill it out

After that's done you would be asked to choose a template we will choose "Video Conferencing" for now then click on "Set up App"

After you're App is set click on "Go to Dashboard" or [Go Here](https://dashboard.100ms.live/dashboard)

<Text id='2' toc='Getting Token Endpoint'>

## Get Token Endpoint

Any service calling 100ms' REST APIs need to authenticate using a management token. You can generate Tokens via `Token Generation endpoint` that is provided by 100ms.

After you're done with creating an account head over to the developer section of [100ms Dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/developer). You will find all `Access Credentials` here including `Token Endpoint`.

## Creating Room

Now to get `room_id` get over to [Room in Dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/rooms) and click on "Create Room" , While creating a room you can specify it's name, roles or enable recording.

You will now see "Room Details" section and we have a `room_id` created.

</Text>

<View id="2" img="/guides/secret.png" />

<Text id='3' toc='Generating Token' >

## Generate Token

Now that we have got our `Token Endpoint` and `room_id` we can now generate our own Token.

We will create a file `getToken.js` in the 'src' folder. Here the `getToken` function takes `room_id` as an argument and makes a `POST` request to the Endpoint and returns token.

> Make sure to replace `<YOUR_TOKEN_ENPOINT>` with your TOKEN ENDPOINT from Dashboard.

</Text>

<View id='3' code>

```jsx
const endPoint = '<YOUR_TOKEN_ENPOINT>';

export default async function getToken(room_id) {
    const response = await fetch(`${endPoint}api/token`, {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify({
            user_id: '5fc62c5872909272bf9995e1', // User ID assigned by you (different from 100ms' assigned id)
            role: 'host', //host, teacher, guest, student
            type: 'app',
            room_id
        })
    });

    const { token } = await response.json();

    return token;
}
```

<Text id='4' toc='Instantiate 100ms Client'>

## Data Store

`@100mslive/react-sdk` provides us a flux based reactive data store layer over 100ms core SDK.This makes state management super easy.

It's core features:

-   **Store** - The reactive store for reading data using selectors. The store acts as a single source of truth for any data related to the room.
-   **Actions** - The actions interface for dispatching actions which in turn may reach out to server and update the store.
-   **Selectors** - These are small functions used to get or subscribe to a portion of the store.

## Instantiate 100ms Client

To harness the power of this Data Store we will 1st create a `<Conference />` component and wrap it around `<HMSRoomProvider />`.

```jsx
import { HMSRoomProvider, useHMSStore } from '@100mslive/react-sdk';
import './index.css';

const Conference = () => {
    return <div>Main Code Here</div>;
};

export default function App() {
    return (
        <div className="w-full h-screen flex items-center flex-col bg-gray-900 text-white">
            <HMSRoomProvider>
                <Conference />
            </HMSRoomProvider>
        </div>
    );
}
```

<Text id='5' toc='Join / Room Screen'>

## Join / Room Screen

There's 2 conditions we will be handling in the `<Conference />` component

1. User has't joined the room -> `<Join />`
2. User has joined the room -> `<Room />`

Create a folder called 'components' and create 2files in it `Join.jsx` & `Room.jsx`

We will keep the `Room.jsx` simple for now as we will be focusing on `Join.jsx`

</Text>

<View id='5' code>

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Join = () => {
    const room_id = `<YOUR_ROOM_ID>`;
    const [userName, setUserName] = useState('Deepankar');
    const [room, setRoom] = useState(room_id);
    return (
        <div className="mt-10">
            <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-200">Join Section</h1>
            <div className="mt-4">
                <input
                    type="text"
                    className="my-5"
                    placeholder="Your name"
                    value={userName}
                    onChange={(e) => setUserName(e.target.value)}
                />
                <button
                    type="button"
                    className="py-2 px-4   text-base font-semibold shadow-md rounded-lg">
                    Join
                </button>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
};

export default Join;
```

<Text id='6' toc='Render Join Component'>

## Render Join

We will render `<Join />` when user hasn't joined the room and `<Room />` when joined.

So if the user has joined the room we will use the function `selectIsConnectedToRoom` this would return if the peer is connected to the room.

You can read more about getting peer's state in our [docs](https://docs.100ms.live/v2/web-frameworks/Getting-started-react#get-peers-states).

The value of `isConnected` would false because we haven't joined the room.

Now if you start your dev server by running `yarn start` or `npm run start` you should be able see this in your browser.

import {
  HMSRoomProvider,
  useHMSStore,
  selectIsConnectedToRoom,
} from '@100mslive/react-sdk';
import Join from './components/Join';
import Room from './components/Room';
import './index.css';

const Conference = () => {
  // is the peer connected
  const isConnected = useHMSStore(selectIsConnectedToRoom);
  return <>{isConnected ? <Room /> : <Join />}</>;
};

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div className='w-full min-h-screen flex items-center flex-col bg-gray-900 text-white'>
      <HMSRoomProvider>
        <Conference />
      </HMSRoomProvider>
    </div>
  );
}
```

<Text id='7' toc='Join Audio Room'>

## Join Room

To join a room we need to call the function `hmsActions.join()` which takes a config as an argument.

As showm below the config needs an `authToken` that we will generate using `getToken()` function we made before , `room_id` and `username` can be derived from their respective states.

You can read more about it in our [docs](https://docs.100ms.live/v2/web-frameworks/Getting-started-react#provide-joining-configuration-and-join-a-room).

When the user clickes on "Join" we should generate an `authToken` and call `hmsAction.join()` function.

Let's create a function "joinRoom" in `Join.jsx`

</Text>

<View id='7' code>

```jsx{2-3,10-25,31-33}
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { useHMSActions } from '@100mslive/react-sdk';
import getToken from '../getToken';

const Join = () => {
  const room_id = `<YOUR_ROOM_ID>`;
  const [userName, setUserName] = useState('Deepankar');
  const [room, setRoom] = useState(room_id);
  const hmsActions = useHMSActions();
  const joinRoom = () => {
    getToken(room_id)
      .then((token) => {
        hmsActions.join({
          authToken: token,
          userName,
          settings: {
            isAudioMuted: true,
            isVideoMuted: true,
          },
        });
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        console.log('Token API Error', error);
      });
  };
  return (
    <div className='mt-10'>
      <h1 className='text-3xl font-bold text-gray-200'>Join Section</h1>
      <div className='mt-4'>
          <input
            type='text'
            className='my-5'
            placeholder='Your name'
            value={userName}
            onChange={(e) => setUserName(e.target.value)}
          />
        <button
          type='button'
          className='py-2 px-4   text-base font-semibold shadow-md rounded-lg'
          onClick={() => joinRoom()}
        >
          Join
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Join;
```

<Text id='8' toc='Adding Controls'>

## Controls

To know the states of Peer's Audio/Video is enabled we will used another selector function `selectIsLocalAudioEnabled`.

To toggle audio and video we will use `hmsActions.setLocalAudioEnabled()` refer it's docs [here](https://docs.100ms.live/v2/web-frameworks/Getting-started-react#muting-unmuting).

Leaving Room is very simple we just call `hmsActions.leave()` function.

We will create a new component `Controls.jsx`

</Text>

<View id='8' code>

```jsx
import { selectIsLocalAudioEnabled, useHMSActions, useHMSStore } from '@100mslive/react-sdk';
import React from 'react';

const Controls = () => {
    const isLocalAudioEnabled = useHMSStore(selectIsLocalAudioEnabled);
    const hmsActions = useHMSActions();
    const toggleAudio = async () => {
        await hmsActions.setLocalAudioEnabled(!isLocalAudioEnabled);
    };
    const leaveRoom = () => {
        hmsActions.leave();
    };

    return (
        <div className="relative">
            <button onClick={toggleAudio} className="p-2 rounded mx-2">
                {isLocalAudioEnabled ? 'Mic ON' : 'Mic Off'}
            </button>
            <button onClick={() => leaveRoom()} className="p-2  rounded mx-2 bg-red-500">
                Leave Room
            </button>
        </div>
    );
};
```
