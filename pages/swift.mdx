### What is JavaScript?

```swift
  // Basic Usage
  hms = HMSSDK.build() // ensure to keep an instance of HMSSDK alive in the class as an instance property
  let config = HMSConfig(userID: "userID", roomID: "roomID", authToken: "authToken")
  hms?.join(config: config, delegate: self)
  // Advanced Usage
  hms = HMSSDK.build { (hms) in
            hms.logLevel = .verbose
            hms.analyticsLevel = .verbose
            let videoSettings = HMSVideoTrackSettings(maxBitrate: 512,
                                                      maxFrameRate: 25,
                                                      cameraFacing: .front,
                                                      trackDescription: "Just a normal video track")
            let audioSettings = HMSAudioTrackSettings(maxBitrate: 32, trackDescription: "Just a normal audio track")
            hms.trackSettings = HMSTrackSettings(videoSettings: videoSettings, audioSettings: audioSettings)
            hms.logger = self
        }

  let config = HMSConfig(userName: "userName",
                           userID: "userID",
                           roomID: "roomID",
                        authToken: "authToken",
              shouldSkipPIIEvents: true,
                         metaData: "someMetaData",
                         endpoint: "wss://myWebSocketEndpoint/ws")

  hms?.join(config: config, delegate: self)
```

JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.

The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.

Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.

In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called Java.

Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or actually on any device that has a special program called the JavaScript engine.

The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a “JavaScript virtual machine”.

Different engines have different “codenames”. For example:

-   V8 – in Chrome and Opera.
-   SpiderMonkey – in Firefox.
-   There are other codenames like “Chakra” for IE, “ChakraCore” for Microsoft Edge, “Nitro” and “SquirrelFish” for Safari, etc.

The terms above are good to remember because they are used in developer articles on the internet. We’ll use them too. For instance, if “a feature X is supported by V8”, then it probably works in Chrome and Opera.
