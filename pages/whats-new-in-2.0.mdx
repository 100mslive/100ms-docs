# What's new in 2.0

---

100ms 2.0 is a collection of simple, powerful abstraction of WebRTC interfaces. Its a generational change from 100ms 1.0 \(and similar webRTC SDK providers\)

Moving to 2.0 has 2 objectives

-   **Reduce boilerplate for audio-video capture and connection handling**  
    With the current `publish` `subscribe` architecture that is common across most WebRTC SDK providers, developers spend months discovering and writing boilerplate code for handling

    -   camera capture failures
    -   browser incompatibility
    -   disconnections _\(this is a pandora's box - what's the reason for disconnection - TURN/IPv6/network congestion? is the error retryable?\)_
    -   moving app into background, switching apps
    -   switching quality to manage network degradation etc.

-   **Add more powerful interfaces for adding interactivity, customisation quickly** None of the current WebRTC SDK providers were built for a world where annotations, multiple roles, reactions, games need to be built on top of the audio-video experience. This manifests in -
    -   Adding an annotation/chat plugin typically means integrating a third-party plugin and a separate data channel
    -   Maintaining stream priority/UI basis roles \(teacher's screenshare should be higher priority than student's video, on-stage people should be able to see back-stage people but not the audience\) requires building parallel infrastructure
    -   Adding any complex post-call features - custom recording layouts, custom RTMP layouts, transcription analytics - are either not possible or too complicated to build on your own
