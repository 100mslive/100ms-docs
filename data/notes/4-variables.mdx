### JavaScript Variables

Like many other programming languages, JavaScript has variables. Variables can be thought of as named containers. You can place data into these containers and then refer to the data simply by naming the container.

Before you use a variable in a JavaScript program, you must declare it. Variables are declared with the var keyword as follows.

### Scopes

-   Global Variables − A global variable has global scope which means it can be defined anywhere in your JavaScript code.

-   Local Variables − A local variable will be visible only within a function where it is defined. Function parameters are always local to that function.

```html:index.html
<html>
   <body onload = checkscope();>
      <script type = "text/javascript">
            var myVar = "global";      // Declare a global variable
            function checkscope() {
               var myVar = "local";    // Declare a local variable
               document.write(myVar);
            }
      </script>
   </body>
</html>
```
