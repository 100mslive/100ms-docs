## Overview

**SFU recording** - This recording does individual peer recording and also post session outputs a mp4 composition as well. SFU recording has two steps it first generates webm files for individual peers and then composes them to form the mp4. SFU recording has a fixed layout and composition.

SFU recording usually takes 1.5x of time to process and return the composed recording. eg 2 peers for 60 min, recording composition will be available 2*60*1 = 120 minutes, once the session is completed.

SFU recording composition will be received in a webhook call [recording.success](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/introduction/webhook#recording-success)

**Browser recording** - This recording gives a mp4 as an output and is basically a virtual browser that joins the room as a peer and recording what it sees. Browser recording can be [customised](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/introduction/authentication-and-tokens) to any look and feel. The recording time post session is close to 5-10 minutes once the session is done. Browser recording will be received in a webhook call [beam.recording.sucess](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/introduction/webhook#beam-recording-success)

-   Create multiples roles say Guest, Host and Beam
    > **Note**: The beam role is not publishing anything but subscribes to the Guest and Host\*\*
-   So once beam joins the room it will record the Host and Guest.
-   Also this will make beam video tile of beam from showing up on the UI as well.
