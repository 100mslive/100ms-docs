## Overview

To join and interact with others in audio or video call, the user needs to join a `room`.

When a user indicates that they want to _join_ the room, your app should have -

1. User Name - The name which should be displayed to other peers in the room.
2. [Authentication Token](../guides/token) - The Client side Authentication Token generated by the Token Service.

You can also optionally pass these fields -

1. Track Settings - Such as joining a Room with Muted Audio or Video using the `HMSTrackSetting` object. More information available [here](#join-with-muted-audio-video)

2. User Metadata - This can be used to pass any additional metadata associated with the user using `metadata` of [HMSConfig object](https://pub.dev/documentation/hmssdk_flutter/latest/hmssdk_flutter/HMSConfig-class.html). For Eg: user-id mapping at the application side. More information is available [here](../advanced-features/peer-metadata-update).
