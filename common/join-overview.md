## Overview

To join and interact with others in audio or video call, the user needs to join a `room`.

When a user indicates that they want to _join_ the room, your app should have -

1. User Name - The name which should be displayed to other peers in the room.
2. [Authentication Token](../guides/token) - The client-side authentication token generated by the token service.
