## Overview

Live video interactions can span across levels of interactivity; for instance, in a virtual event, some participants may be on stage conversing, while others off stage listen

At 100ms, we categorize live video interactions into three levels of interactivity. This enables you to construct live video use-cases by mixing and matching these levels to achieve your ideal solution.

-   **On Stage** (WebRTC): Full duplex audio/video in real-time\
    On stage participants can publish their audio/video and interact with others with sub-second latency, similar to real-time video conferencing platforms like Zoom or Google Meet

-   **Off Stage** (WebRTC): Webinar-style audience with sub-second latency

    Off stage pariticpants consume audio/video from On stage participants with sub-second latency but do not publish their own audio/video. They can, however, engage with on stage participants through messaging, such as chat, emojis, and custom events, similar to a Zoom webinar.
    Both on stage and off stage interactions are enabled using WebRTC.

-   **Delayed Stream** (HLS): Live stream audience consuming a delayed Stream (\<10s delay)

    Delayed Stream particpants consume a composite live stream, with less than 10 seconds of latency, without publishing their own audio/video, interacting with other participants via messaging. This experience is similar to platforms like Twitch or YouTube Live and is facilitated through 100ms Interactive Live Streaming

    Live streaming uses [HLS](https://www.100ms.live/blog/hls-101-beginners-guide) to achieve near real-time latency at scale.

The [roles primitive](/javascript/v2/foundation/templates-and-roles#roles) allows defining participant capabilities and associating them with an interaction level, enabling participants to move between levels with a single API call to change roles.

## Try Interactive Live Streaming

Create your Live Streaming use-case using [Prebuilt and Customiser](https://www.100ms.live/marketplace/live-streaming-starter-kit) to try out the experience before you write a line of code.

### Create a new template

![Live streaming starter kit](/docs/v2/live-streaming/live-streaming-template.png)

1. Make sure that you have [an account with 100ms](https://dashboard.100ms.live/register), then go to [100ms dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/)
1. On the dashboard, start by creating a new Template and select the Live Streaming use-case
1. Configure the template with your preferences
1. Select add-ons such as recording and storage
1. Specify a template name, subdomain and region

### Understand roles

![Live Streaming roles](/docs/v2/live-streaming/live-streaming-roles.png)

This preset configures your new template with 4/5 [roles](/javascript/v2/foundation/templates-and-roles). All rooms created based on this template will have this configuration.

-   `broadcaster`: This role represents a streamer who can publish their audio/video. There can be multiple peers who join as broadcasters
-   `co-broadcaster`: This role represents a streamer who can publish their audio/video but cannot start/end the streaming session
-   `viewer-realtime`: This role represents a participant at level 2 (WebRTC), who subscribes participants at level 1, but cannot publish audio/video
-   `viewer-near-realtime`: This role represents a participant at level 3 (HLS), who subscribes to the composite live stream and can interact using messaging

### Go live
<video loop="true" autoplay="autoPlay" controls="false" id="vid" muted>
    <source src="/docs/docs/v2/live-streaming/live-streaming-go-live.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

1. To go live for the first time, join the room as a `broadcaster` and start the live stream
2. Once the stream has started, join the room as an `viewer-realtime` and you should be able to see the ongoing live stream
3. Use chat messages to interact between the viewer and the broadcaster

### Customize the stream

![Go live](/docs/v2/live-streaming-customise.png)

By default, the live stream is composed in landscape mode for desktop viewers (with an aspect ratio of 16:9). You can customise the live stream for viewers on mobile or to support multiple broadcaster tiles.

1. On the 100ms dashboard, click the gear icon on your app to open configuration settings
2. Go to "destinations" and scroll down to find live stream (HLS) configuration
3. Update the configuration based on your needs:
    - If your viewers are on mobile, change the video aspect ratio to 9:16
    - If you have multiple broadcasters joining in, choose grid or active speaker based on your needs
    - In case of grid layout, choose the tile size that fits your use-case. For example, a stream with 2 streamers looks better with 1:1 tiles.

## Integrate in your app

To integrate 100ms Interactive Live Streaming in your app, follow these steps:

1. [Enable live streaming](#enable-live-streaming)
2. [Integrate the 100ms SDK in your app](#sdk-integration)
3. [Integrate live stream playback](#live-stream-playback)
4. [Video on demand (VOD) use cases](#video-on-demand-vod-use-cases)

### Enable live streaming

![Enable live streaming](/docs/v2/live-streaming-enable.png)

If your app is based on the Live Streaming Starter Kit (as shown above), the live streaming destination is enabled out-of-the-box.

For custom apps, you can enable the live streaming destination manually:

1. Open configuration for your existing app using the 100ms dashboard
1. In the "destinations" tab, enable "Live Streaming with HLS"
1. Ensure that you have roles for the broadcaster (who can publish their audio/video) and the viewer (who cannot publish audio/video)

### SDK integration

Use the 100ms client-side SDKs to integrate streaming in your application. See code snippets for the client-side SDK [here](/javascript/v2/how--to-guides/record-and-live-stream/hls/hls).

### Live stream playback

Using our client-side SDKs, you can enable live stream playback and add interactive experiences like chat, raise hand and other functionalities to your app using [peer metadata](/javascript/v2/advanced-features/peer-metadata).

The process is so simple:

1. Once you [start](#step-3-go-live) live streaming, you will get an HLS URL (M3U8 URL) which you can use for playback.
2. You can use the [client-side SDK](/javascript/v2/how--to-guides/record-and-live-stream/hls/hls) to get the HLS URL by checking the [current state](/javascript/v2/how--to-guides/record-and-live-stream/hls/hls#current-room-status) of the room and start playback.

If you need to only enable HLS playback and don't need interactivity, you can follow one of the below approaches to get the HLS URL:

-   **Webhook:** You can listen to `hls.started.success` [webhook event](/server-side/v2/introduction/webhook#hls-started-success) and get the HLS URL from the `url` field. Please check the [webhooks guide](/server-side/v2/introduction/webhook) to learn more about webhooks.
-   **Static URL:** This configuration will help you get a static URL for playback. You can enable the `Static playback URLs` in your template from the [dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/dashboard). You can go to Destination > enable "Live streaming with HLS" > under "Stream Video Output" section > enable "Static Playback URLs"

    -   _Format_: `https://cdn.100ms.live/beam/<customer_id>/<room_id>/master.m3u8`
    -   `customer_id`: replace this placeholder with your customer_id from [developer section](https://dashboard.100ms.live/developer) on your dashboard.
    -   `room_id`: replace this placeholder with the `room_id` of the respective room from which the stream will be broadcasted.

### Video on Demand (VOD) use cases

If you wish to replay your HLS stream for Video on demand (VOD) use case, 100ms provides the capability to record the HLS stream which will be posted to your webhook as a ZIP file of M3U8 format (same playback format as HLS) with all the chunks once the stream ends.

You can start recording a live stream using the [client-side SDK](/javascript/v2/how--to-guides/record-and-live-stream/hls/hls) or using the [server API](/server-side/v2/Destinations/rtmp-streaming-and-browser-recording#start-streaming-recording). Once the HLS recording is completed, you will get the details of recording as a callback to the webhook configured in your account. Check `hls.recording.success` [webhook event](/server-side/v2/introduction/webhook#hls-recording-success) for more information.
