## Introduction

Template is the blueprint of the room. It defines the settings of the room along with the behavior of users who are part of it.
Room will inherit the properties from a template that you have specified while creating it. If you have not specified any template then it will pick the default template.
Each template will be identified by its id or name. E.g. `default_videoconf_7e450ffc-8ef1-4572-ab28-b32474107b89`

Users can see or modify the templates by visiting [Templates on Dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/templates) or via API(see below). After updating a template or some part of its like permissions, you need to rejoin or restart the session for the template updates to take place.

## Roles

Role is a collection of permissions that allows you to perform certain set of operations while being part of the room. It has the following attributes:

### Name

Every role has a name that should be unique inside a template. This name will be used while generating app tokens and referencing inside a template.

### Priority

Priority will determine the order in which the roles will be degraded. A lower number represents a higher priority.

### Publish Strategies

Publish strategies will be used to determine the tracks and their quality which can be published by this role.

### Room State

Room state settings control the strategy of sending room state updates sent to our client SDK consumers.



| Setting                           | Description                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Room-state Message Interval (in seconds)    | Room-state data will be sent over a regular interval of these many seconds.  Consequently, the room state displayed on the preview screen will refresh accordingly. This value must be a multiple of 5, between 5 and 3600 seconds, both inclusive.                                   |
| Send Peer List in Room-state                | Enabling this will send peer-list info of the room. If disabled, only the peer count is sent.                   |
| Enable Room-State                           | If enabled, room-state data will be sent to the preview screen. If disabled, no such room-state data will be sent.|
| Roles with room-state permission           | This is the list of all the roles which will get the room-state data. You can also individually toggle these settings in the Roles tab under the Permissions section.                               |
