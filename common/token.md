## Get a temporary token from 100ms dashboard

Any client connecting calling 100ms' service needs to authenticate using an auth token. In production you would have your own servers generating the tokens (see more [here](/docs/javascript/v2/foundation/security-and-tokens)), but for a quick start you can use the dashboard to create a token for you. The token will expire in 24 hours and should not be hard-coded into a production app.

- To get a temporary token click on "Join room" button.

![Join Room](/docs/guides/token/join-room.png)

- In the popup that shows up click on icon with a key shape next to the role you want to join as.

![Copy Token](/docs/guides/token/copy-token.png)

The token will be copied to your clipboard. Use this along with the `room_id` to proceed with the quickstart guide.
