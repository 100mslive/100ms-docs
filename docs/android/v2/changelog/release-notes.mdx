## v2.7.2 - 2023-07-13

### Fix
- Override the local peer name given in preview with the name given in join

## v2.7.1 - 2023-07-13

### Changed
- Unnecessary imports for `hls-player` were removed.
- Analytics related fixes
- Pixel distortion issue using SimulcastEncoderFactory

## v2.6.8 - 2023-06-28

### Added
- Added option to NOT mute when phone is in ringing state. Using this also means that SDK cannot mute local peer on receiving a VoIP phone call

## v2.6.7 - 2023-06-2

### Added
- SDK now sends detailed analytics from the webrtc publisher side for debugging call quality issues.

## v2.6.6 - 2023-05-29

### Breaking Changes
- SessionStore's `onKeyChangeListener` now returns `JsonElement` instead of `Any`
- The deprecated methods for `setSessionMetaData` and `getSessionMetaData` were removed. Please use the [SessionStore](../how-to-guides/interact-with-room/room/session-store) directly instead.

### Fix
- SessionStore API fix: While it can still take `Any` datatypes, it must return `JsonElement` because the SDK can't parse the values back. Do see changes to the [doc](../how-to-guides/interact-with-room/room/session-store)
- Internal library path updates, no client visible changes.
- HMSTrack when compared to null, would crash. `track == track?` for instance.

### Added
- MeetingUrl is now optional for rtmp/recordings


## v2.6.5 - 2023-05-23

### Fix
- Fix `captureImageAtMaxSupportedResolution()` not working on certain devices which were using legacy camera1 API.

## v2.6.4 - 2023-05-18

### Added
- `HMSMessage` now has `messageId` assigned to each message. After sending a message, add it to the UI from the `onMessageSuccess` callback to read the unique messageId.

## v2.6.3 - 2023-05-08

### Fix
- Fixed video distortion in all Pixel devices by forcing s/w encoder.

## v2.6.2 - 2023-05-01

### Breaking Changes
- KeyChangeListener for the session store now returns `Any` instead of `String` as data. This is equivalent to `Object` in Java.

### Added
- Simplifying how the videos can be shown on the app. [Here's](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-android/pull/358/files) the code it reduces.
- Session Store now receives data of Any/Object type rather than just strings.

### Fix
- Removing the key listeners in `HmsSessionStore` when disconnected could've crashed the app.
- Role changing a non-hls role to hls and back would result in its tracks not being seen by new peers joining the call.

## v2.6.1 - 2023-04-14

### Breaking Changes
- Hls stats is overhauled and now part of the new hls-player library.

### Added
- [HmsHlsPlayer](../how--to-guides/record-and-live-stream/hls-player). A new library that simplifies co-ordinating events on hls live streams with the app.
- [Session Store](https://www.100ms.live/docs/android/v2/how--to-guides/interact-with-room/room/session-store) a room level real time key-value store that can be updated and listened to by any peer.

### Changed
- `volume` is a public property on `HMSRemoteAudioTrack.kt`

### Fix
- Bug that caused tracks to disappear after a peer's role was changed, with certain types of roles.
- When logging was enabled, logs weren't being cleared in some cases resulting in the disk filling up on the device.
- Internal analytics changes.
- Crash with a certain type of notification.

## v2.6.0 - 2023-03-31

### Breaking Changes
- getToken() is an instance level api and returns a string in onSuccess instead of a TokenResult object. It modifies an API introduced in 2.5.9. [Docs](https://www.100ms.live/docs/android/v2/get-started/quickstart#get-auth-token)
- `customerUserID` is now nullable for both `HMSLocalPeer` and `HMSRemotePeer`.

### Added
- Audio is unsubscribed from if the volume is set to zero. This saves data during calls with a lot of muted peers.

### Fixed
- Updated internal analytics properties.

## v2.5.9 - 2023-03-17

### Added
- Short Codes to join rooms - Rather than requiring your server infrastructure for authenticating users, you can now use a 100ms API to generate tokens for users. A user with a given short code can login as a certain role. One short code per role for each room.

### Fixed
- Analytics improvements to better measure 100ms performance.

## v2.5.8 - 2023-03-07

### Added
- Allow echo cancellation, noise suppression and automatic gain control to be configureable from `HMSAudioTrackSettings`.
- Limit the number of peers in the room with [Max Peer Count](https://www.100ms.live/docs/javascript/v2/how--to-guides/debugging/faq#is-there-any-way-to-limit-participants-in-a-room).
- Added extra analytics for 100ms. (cluster)
- Improved manual focus for the camera.

### Fixed
- Fixed Remote peerâ€™s HMSRole having empty permissions, publish params and subscribe params.
- Pixel 3 phones now always use software decoders to resolve an issue that happens when they don't.
- Send screenshare track info separately in local statistics.

## v2.5.7 - 2023-01-20

### Added

-   Send `requested_by` in acceptChangeRole message
-   Added `CameraControls` interface to `HMSLocalVideoTrack` - Check details about this [here](https://www.100ms.live/docs/android/v2/advanced-features/camera-controls)

### Fixed

-   `captureBitmap` API of the local `HMSVideoView` now returns the bitmap at the publishing resolution of local peer
-   Sometimes `HMSTrack` was in-correctly removed from `HMSPeer` if a `RemotePeer` un-publishes a `HMSTrack` and re-publishes it again

## v2.5.6 - 2023-01-11

### Added

-   New API in SDK to send Timed Metadata while streaming to hls viewers

### Fixed

-   `isScreenShared()` API always returning `false`
-   Multiple setLayer call in `HMSVideoView`

### Changed

-   `onJoin` notification will come before `onPeerUpdate` when user joined a room. Earlier it used to be sent later
-   Prefer layer is now request response instead of notify
-   `onLocalVideoStats` of `HMSStatsObserver` now has a `List` of `HMSLocalVideoStats` instead of single object to accomodate for Simulcast layers

## v2.5.5 - 2022-12-17

### Fixed

-   `TRACK_REMOVE` update not being sent for screen-share to a new peer who joined the room when screen-share was already in progress

## v2.5.4 - 2022-12-15

### Added

-   [Auto Simulcast](https://www.100ms.live/docs/android/v2/migrations/surfaceview-migration) - HMSVideoView when used, changes the simulcast layer based on its size automatically to reduce bandwidth consumption.
-   [Bulk role change](https://www.100ms.live/docs/android/v2/features/change-role#bulk-role-change) - A list of roles an be provided to change several peers with that role to a single one with one API call.

### Fixed

-   Only a single update is sent for a local peer when their role is changed instead of two.

### Deprecated

-   The method `changeRole` is now `changeRoleForPeer`. No functional changes.

#### Added

-   Network Quality in preview. [Network quality](/android/v2/how--to-guides/measure-network-quality-and-performance/network-quality-reports) reports can now be requested at the preview screen. Use the returned value to determine if you should suggest people's internet is too slow to join with video etc.

#### Changed

-   Synced leave function

## 2.1.6 - 2021-10-28

#### Breaking Changes

`requestedBy: HMSPeer` in `HMSChangeTrackStateRequest` is now nullable.
It could be mute if the person tried to mute or unmute someone and immediately left the room.

#### Fixed

-   Check for Role change of remote peers after reconnection
-   Return correct value of isPlaybackAllowed
-   HMSTrack is null for local peer in HMSSpeaker
-   `onSuccess` callback for the `acceptChangeRequest` method was never being called. This will now be called appropriately.
    This request can safely be ignored because the SDK already muted the peer but may be helpful in recognizing that the mute came externally.
    A check like the following is now required in your `onChangeTrackStateRequest`:

```kotlin
            if (details.track.isMute != details.mute) {
              // Process ChangeTrackMuteRequest
            }
```

#### Added

-   Added `customerId` and `description` to HMSPeer's tostring().
-   `HMSChangeTrackStateRequest` is now sent even when peers are muted. Previously, if a remote peer requested a peer to mute, there would be no ChangeTrackStateRequest
-   The way packet loss is measured for track degradation is changed
