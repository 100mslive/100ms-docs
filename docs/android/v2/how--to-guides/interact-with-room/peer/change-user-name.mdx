title: Change User Name
nav: 10.2

Any peer can change their own name before or after joining a room. Before joining, the name would have to be specified in `HMSConfig` that is passed to the join method. This document shows how the name can be changed after joining.

## Responding to name changes

Whenever a remote peer's name is changed a callback will be received in `onPeerUpdate(update : HMSPeerUpdate, peer : HMSPeer)` of `HMSUpdateListener` where the `update` will be of type `HMSPeerUpdate.NAME_CHANGED`.

When this callback is received the UI for that peer should be updated as well.

## Changing the name

The peer who wants to change their name should call the following method on an `HMSSdk` instance.

    }
});
