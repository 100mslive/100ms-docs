title: End Room
nav: 10.1

Done with talking and it's time to end the video call room for everyone not just yourself? You may be looking to end the room.

### Permissions

Can't let just anyone end the video call room. First you need to create a [role](/android/v2/foundation/templates-and-roles) with the permissions to end a room.

The permission to end a room is called `PermissionsParams.endRoom` and you should check for that within the `HMSRole` of the peer to see if they have it.

Here's how to check whether the local peer has the permission to end the room:

<Tabs id="endroom" items={['Kotlin', 'Java 8', 'Java 7']} />

<Tab id='endroom-0'>

```kotlin
fun isAllowedToEndMeeting(): Boolean {
    return hmsSDK.getLocalPeer()!!
                .hmsRole.permission?
                .endRoom == true
}

```

</Tab>

<Tab id='endroom-1'>

```java
private boolean hasEndRoomPermissions() {
   return Optional.ofNullable(hmsSdk.getLocalPeer())
           .map(HMSPeer::getHmsRole)
           .map(HMSRole::getPermission)
           .map(PermissionsParams::getEndRoom)
           .orElse(false);
}
```

 </Tab>
 
<Tab id='endroom-2'>

```java
private boolean hasEndRoomPermissions() {
    HMSLocalPeer peer = hmsSdk.getLocalPeer();
    if(peer != null) {
        HMSRole role = peer.getHmsRole();
        if(role != null) {
            PermissionsParams permissions = role.getPermission();
            if(permissions != null) {
                return permissions.getEndRoom();
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

</Tab>

`hmsSdk.getLocalPeer()` will not return null as long as you're in a preview or in a meeting. Since you likely won't need to check for permissions if you're not in one it would be ok.

### Ending the Room

Once you're sure the peer has the permissions to end the room, they can end it by calling `hmsSdk.endRoom`.

`endRoom` takes three parameters.

1. _message_: The String message you want to show people when they are forced to leave. This is a good place to thank them for joining the room and informing them that it has ended.
2. _lock_: A Boolean for whether you want to prevent anyone from rejoining the room. If false, they will be allowed to enter the room again if the client called `join`. If this is true, they will NOT able to join this room again.
3. _hmsActionResultListener_: These are the callbacks that let you know whether the room was ended successfully or not. If the room could be closed, `onSuccess` will be called. For any errors `onError` will be called with the appropriate `HMSException`.

> ðŸ’¡ After calling endRoom the video calling UI should be disposed of as well since only the other peers will get the `onPeerRemoved` callback. The caller has to rely on the `onSuccess` callback for `endRoom` to decide when to terminate the meeting room UI locally.

<Tabs id="endroomcall" items={['Kotlin', 'Java']} />

<Tab id='endroomcall-0'>

```kotlin
val message = "Closing time. Thanks for coming!"
val lock = false

hmsSDK.endRoom(message, lock, object : HMSActionResultListener{
    override fun onError(error: HMSException) {
    }

    override fun onSuccess() {
    }
})
```

</Tab>

<Tab id='endroomcall-1'>

```java
String message = "Closing time. Thanks for coming!";
boolean lock = false;

hmsSDK.endRoom(message, lock, new HMSActionResultListener() {
    @Override
    public void onSuccess() {

    }

    @Override
    public void onError(@NonNull HMSException e) {

    }
});
```

</Tab>

### How to handle an end room callback for receivers

Once the peer with adequate permissions calls `endRoom`, all other peers in the room will receive a callback in `HMSUpdateListener.onRemovedFromRoom`.

The `onRemovedFromRoom` callback has a single parameter called `HMSRemovedFromRoom` with the following structure.

```kotlin
data class HMSRemovedFromRoom(
    val reason : String,
    val peerWhoRemoved : HMSRemotePeer?,
    val roomWasEnded : Boolean
)
```

> ðŸ’¡ This is the same callback that will be triggered if a peer was [removed from a room](/android/v2/how--to-guides/interact-with-room/interact-with-peer/remove-peer) as well. Except that `roomEnded` will be true when the entire room was ended.

-   _reason_: The string message detailing why the room was ended.
-   _peerWhoRemoved_: The details of the peer who called `endRoom`.
-   _roomWasEnded_: True if the entire room was ended. False if only the receiving peer was removed.

Clients should read this callback and show the appropriate UI.
