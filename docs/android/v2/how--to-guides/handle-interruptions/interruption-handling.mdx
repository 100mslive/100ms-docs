nav: 6.1

You're chatting away on your video call and, uh-oh, a phone call comes in. No worries, the 100ms SDK abstracts away handling this situation for you.

When a telephonic voice call comes in and the user accepts the following happens.

-   All videos including your own are turned off.
-   You are muted.

When the call ends the SDK will restore all videos, taking care not to un-mute you if you had muted yourself before the call came in. Neither will it un-mute all the peers if you had muted them from the app.

No code required, this happens automatically for all calls.
