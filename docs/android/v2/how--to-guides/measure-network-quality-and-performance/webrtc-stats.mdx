title: Stats for WebRTC
nav: 13.3
---

Sometimes you need a way to capture certain metrics related to a call. This may be helpful if you want to tailor the experience to your users or debug issues. Typical metrics of interest are audio/video bitrate, round trip time, total consumed bandwidth and packet loss. 100ms SDK provides this data via dedicated delegate callbacks found in `HMSStatsObserver`. These will be called with a fixed interval of one second after a room has been joined. You can get stats on a per track basis ( `fun onRemoteAudioStats(audioStats: HMSRemoteAudioStats, hmsTrack: HMSTrack?, hmsPeer: HMSPeer?)`) or as an overall summary (`fun onRTCStats(rtcStats: HMSRTCStatsReport)`).

To begin getting callbacks for statistics, call `hmsSDK.addRtcStatsObserver(HMSStatsObserver)` with your implementation of `HMSStatsObserver`.

> ðŸ’¡ Note: Gathering stats takes several ms and can be a large operation if requested on a room with thousands of peers. Consider whether the additional load is necessary.

Here is the full list of callbacks:

```kotlin
/// This callback provides stats for a local audio track.
fun onLocalAudioStats(audioStats: HMSLocalAudioStats, hmsTrack: HMSTrack?, hmsPeer: HMSPeer?)

/// This callback provides stats for a local video track.
fun onLocalVideoStats(videoStats: HMSLocalVideoStats, hmsTrack: HMSTrack?, hmsPeer: HMSPeer?)

/// This callback provides stats for a remote audio track.
fun onRemoteAudioStats(audioStats: HMSRemoteAudioStats, hmsTrack: HMSTrack?, hmsPeer: HMSPeer?)

/// This callback provides stats for a remote video track.
fun onRemoteVideoStats(videoStats: HMSRemoteVideoStats, hmsTrack: HMSTrack?, hmsPeer: HMSPeer?)

/// This callback provides combined stats for the session.
fun onRTCStats(rtcStats: HMSRTCStatsReport)
```

## HMSRTCStatsReport

This class will contain the combined stats for the room.

```kotlin
class HMSRTCStats {
	// Total bytes sent in the current session.
	val bytesSent: Long
	// Total bytes received in the current session.
	val bytesReceived: Long
	// Total packets received in the current session.
	val packetsReceived: Long
	// Total packets lost in the current session.
	val packetsLost: Long
	// Total outgoing bitrate observed since previous report.
	val bitrateSent: Double
	// Total incoming bitrate observed since previous report in Kb/s.
	val bitrateReceived: Double
	// Average round trip time observed since previous report in seconds.
	val roundTripTime: Double
}

class HMSRTCStatsReport {
	// Combined audio + video values
	val combined: HMSRTCStats
	// Summary of all audio tracks
	val audio: HMSRTCStats
	// Summary of all video tracks
	val video: HMSRTCStats
}
```

## HMSLocalAudioStats

This class contains stats related to local audio track.

```kotlin
data class HMSLocalAudioStats(
	// Round trip time observed since previous report.
	val roundTripTime: Double?,
	// Total bytes sent by this track in the current session.
	val bytesSent: Long?,
	// Outgoing bitrate of this track observed since previous report in Kb/s.
	val bitrate: Double?
) : HMSStats.HMSLocalStats()
```

## HMSLocalVideoStats

This class contains stats related to local video track.

```kotlin
data class HMSLocalVideoStats(
	// Round trip time observed since previous report.
	val roundTripTime: Double?,
	// Total bytes sent by this track in the current session.
	val bytesSent: Long?,
	// Outgoing bitrate of this track observed since previous report in Kb/s.
	val bitrate: Double?,
	// Resolution of video frames being sent.
	val resolution: HMSVideoResolution?,
	// Frame rate of video frames being sent (FPS).
	val frameRate: Double?
) : HMSStats.HMSLocalStats()

data class HMSVideoResolution(
  var width: Int,
  var height: Int,
)

```

## HMSRemoteAudioStats

This class contains stats related to remote audio track.

```kotlin
data class HMSRemoteAudioStats(
	// Packet Jitter measured in seconds for this track. Calculated as defined in section 6.4.1. of RFC3550.
	val jitter: Double?,
	// Total bytes received by this track in the current session.
	val bytesReceived: Long?,
	// Incoming bitrate of this track observed since previous report in Kb/s.
	val bitrate: Double?,
	// Total packets received by this track in the current session.
	val packetsReceived: Long?,
	// Total packets lost by this track in the current session.
	val packetsLost: Int,
 ) : HMSStats.HMSRemoteStats()
```

## HMSRemoteVideoStats

This class contains stats related to remote video track.

```kotlin
data class HMSRemoteVideoStats(
	// Packet Jitter measured in seconds for this track. Calculated as defined in section 6.4.1. of RFC3550.
	val jitter: Double?,
	// Total bytes received by this track in the current session.
	val bytesReceived: Long?,
	// Incoming bitrate of this track observed since previous report in Kb/s.
	val bitrate: Double?,
	// Total packets received by this track in the current session.
	val packetsReceived: Long?,
	// Total packets lost by this track in the current session.
	val packetsLost: Int?
	// Resolution of video frames being received.
	val resolution: HMSVideoResolution?
	// Frame rate of video frames being received (FPS).
	val frameRate: Double?
 ) : HMSStats.HMSRemoteStats()
```

## Hierarchy

Here's the hierarchy for the sealed classes for stats

```kotlin
sealed class HMSStats {
    sealed class HMSLocalStats : HMSStats()

    sealed class HMSRemoteStats : HMSStats()
}
```
