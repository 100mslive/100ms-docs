100ms Android SDK provides support for creating Picture in Picture mode experience for video calls.

## Minimum Requirements

-   Minimum version required to support PiP is Android 8.0 (API level 26)

### How to add PiP support

1. You need to update the activity tag in the `AndroidManifest.xml`

```xml
        <activity
            ....
            android:supportsPictureInPicture="true"
            android:configChanges="screenSize|smallestScreenSize|screenLayout|orientation"
            ... />
```

2. Pip mode resizes your whole activity to a small conatiner. Inorder to show elements in PiP you would like to hide the visibility of views you don't want to show.

```kotlin
    //To launch pip-mode you can call this
    activity.enterPictureInPictureMode()
    //Optionally you can pass in params to have it in a particular aspect ratio. more info [https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/picture-in-picture]
```

3. Once you enter pip mode, you'll recieve a callback. Over there you can put your own custom logic, to show which custom video tracks should be visibile while in PiP. To hide videos while in PiP you can call `videoTrack.removeSink(surfaceViewRender)`

```kotlin
   override fun onPictureInPictureModeChanged(isInPictureInPictureMode: Boolean) {
    ...
    //hiding views for pip/non-pip layout !
    if (isInPictureInPictureMode) {
      //add logic here to show video tracks which would be visible
      supportActionBar?.hide()
    } else {
      //add logic here to restore video tracks here
      supportActionBar?.show()
    }
  }
```
