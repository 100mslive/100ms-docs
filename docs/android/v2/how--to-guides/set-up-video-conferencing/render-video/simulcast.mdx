 title: Adaptive Bitrate (Simulcast) 
 nav: 4.44
---

Simulcast enables [Adaptive Bitrate](/android/v2/foundation/adaptive-bitrate) (ABR) in video conferencing scenarios. This means 100ms SDKs can upgrade or downgrade video quality for remote tracks based on user preferences or network conditions.

## Minimum Requirements

-   SDK version 2.5.2 or higher
-   Simulcast enabled in room template

## 100ms SDK Simulcast APIs

You interact with the simulcast feature by setting `HMSRemoteVideoTrack`'s `setLayer` function. By default the layer is set to high i.e HMSLayer.HIGH Let's look at the track interface:

```kotlin
class HMSRemoteVideoTrack {

/**
   * Public api to set layer to [HMSLayer.HIGH], [HMSLayer.LOW], [HMSLayer.MEDIUM]
   */
  fun setLayer(HMSLayer: HMSLayer)

	/**
   * Public API to get layers definition
   */
  fun getLayerDefinition() : List<HMSSimulcastLayerDefinition>

	/**
   * Public API to get the current selected HMSLayer
   */
  fun getLayer() : HMSLayer

}

data class HMSSimulcastLayerDefinition(
	val resolution: HMSVideoResolution,
	val layer: HMSLayer
)

enum class HMSLayer
{
	LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH
}
```

Here `getLayerDefinition()` property holds an array of currently available layers for the track and `layer` property is the currently selected layer. Within `HMSSimulcastLayerDefinition` you get its resolution and the layer name such as high/medium/low.
