title: SDK Size Impact
nav: 1.5
---

The exact amount the SDK adds to your app can vary based on a few parameters but the most it will add is as follows:

| Architecture | Size Increase (Uncompressed) | **APK Size Increase (Compressed)** |
|---|---|---|
|x86_64| 11mb | **6mb** |
|x86| 10.8mb | **6.1mb**|
|arm64-v8a|8.8mb|**5.3mb**|
|armeabi-v7|5.7mb|**4.7mb**|

> ðŸ’¡ The webrtc binaries contribute most to the size increase. When inside your apk they are compressed by default so the apk size will only be what you see under **compressed* since the APKs themselves are compressed files.

You could observe the architectures within your app's play store / analytics dashboard to see what the most common architectures are for your customers.
