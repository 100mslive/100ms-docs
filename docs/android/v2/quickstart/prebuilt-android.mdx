## Overview

This guide will walk you through the steps to create a video conferencing app using Prebuilt component of the `room-kit` package.

> If you get stuck at any point or need help in understanding a concept, you can put your query in our [Discord Channel](https://100ms.live/discord).


## Prerequisites

-   _Android_: A basic familiarity with Android is required to follow this guide.
-   _100ms account_: You need to have a 100ms account to create a room and get a `room-code`. You can create a 100ms account [here](https://dashboard.100ms.live/signup).
-   _Room-code_: Prebuilt components require a `room-code` to join a room. You can get a `room-code` for a room using the 100ms dashboard. Refer to [this guide](/get-started/v2/get-started/prebuilt/room-codes/overview) to learn more about room codes.

## Start a New Android Project (or use an existing one)
[Here's how](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/create-project) to create a new Android project.


## Install Roomkit

The `room-kit` library is available on Maven. Add it your app level build.gradle in the dependencies block.

Latest Version:

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/xml.svg?label=100ms-Prebuilt&color=blue&query=%2F%2Fmetadata%2Fversioning%2Flatest&url=https%3A%2F%2Frepo1.maven.org%2Fmaven2%2Flive%2F100ms%2Froom-kit%2Fmaven-metadata.xml)](https://jitpack.io/#100mslive/room-kit)

```groovy
dependencies { ....
    implementation "live.100ms:room-kit:$GET_VERSION_FROM_ABOVE_BADGE"
}
```

## Add the Prebuilt Component

Look up how to get `room code` in [this guide](/get-started/v2/get-started/prebuilt/room-codes/overview).

```kotlin{1-2,12}
import live.hms.roomkit.ui.HMSRoomKit
import live.hms.roomkit.ui.HMSPrebuiltOptions

class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

        val roomCode = "<room-code>"
        val userName = "<my-name>"
        val options = HMSPrebuiltOptions(userName)

        HMSRoomKit.launchPrebuilt(roomCode, this, options)
    }
}
```

## Launch the App
You will see a preview of your own video and can turn it on or off.

## Additional Parameters
Additional properties that can be specified in `HMSPrebuiltOptions` are `userName` and `userId`.

Username: The user's display name.
UserId: An id that you may choose so that peers on 100ms can be associated with customers identifiers from your system.

```kotlin
class HMSPrebuiltOptions {
  val userName : String?, //Peer user name
  val userId: String?, // Optional Customer given User-id
}

```
## Sample Code
The sample project for the library is at https://github.com/100mslive/AndroidPrebuiltDemo#readme you can download the app for it [here](https://github.com/100mslive/AndroidPrebuiltDemo/suites/14604646490/artifacts/827757135).
