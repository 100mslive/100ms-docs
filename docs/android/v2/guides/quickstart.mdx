## Prerequisites

Familiarity with Android Studio and the [fundamentals](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp) of android apps.

## Supported Android API Levels

100ms' Android SDK supports Android API level 21 and higher. It is built for armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, x86, and x86_64 architectures.

### Getting the video call joining link

To join a video call you need an authentication token and a room id. Or a server that will translate the link into them. The [100ms Dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/register) is one way to generate these auth tokens. In production your own server will generate these and manage user authentication.

We encourage you to setup your own server to authenticate users rather than using the 100ms dashboard to do so in production.

For the purposes of this quickstart you can rely on just the 100ms dashboard. Sign up for the 100ms Dashboard [here](https://dashboard.100ms.live/register).

From either the dashboard, or your own server once implemented, you need to generate a video call link. Video call links generated by the 100ms Dashboard look like `https://myname.app.100ms.live/meeting/correct-horse-battery`.

> ⚙️ For Production
>
> With your own server for authentication and link generation, the format of the link is up to you.

### Add SDK dependencies

-   Add the JitPack repository to your root `settings.gradle` at the end of the `respositories` closure:

You can open it in Android Studio by double tapping shift and typing `settings.gradle`.

```json{7}:settings.gradle section=AddSDKDependencies sectionIndex=1
dependencyResolutionManagement {
 repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
 repositories {
 google()
 mavenCentral()
 jcenter() // Warning: this repository is going to shut down soon
 maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
rootProject.name = "MyVideoCallApp"
include ':app'

```

-   Add the 100ms sdk dependency to your app-level `build.gradle` [![](https://jitpack.io/v/100mslive/android-sdk.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#100mslive/android-sdk).

```json{3,4}:build.gradle section=AddSDKDependencies sectionIndex=2
dependencies {
 // See the version in the jitpack badge above.
 implementation 'com.github.100mslive.android-sdk:lib:x.x.x'
    }
```

### Login

#### Request

Here's how to get an auth token with 100ms's demo authentication

1. Sign up to the dashboard.
2. Get your video call link. It should look like `https://myname.app.100ms.live/meeting/correct-horse-battery`
3. Send an http post request to `https://prod-in.100ms.live/hmsapi/get-token`
4. With the header "subdomain" set to `myname.app.100ms.live` if your link was `https://myname.app.100ms.live/meeting/correct-horse-battery`
5. For a link of the type `https://myname.app.100ms.live/meeting/correct-horse-battery` The body is json with the format `{"code": "correct-horse-battery", "user_id":"your-customer-id" }` the user_id can be any random string as well and you can create it with `UUID.randomUUID().toString(),`.

> ⚙️ For Production
>
> Maybe you won't use links at all. You will need to generate tokens on the backend, and rooms for users. Look up the [Token Setup Guide](token) here.

#### Response

The 100ms server will respond with an auth token like this `{"token":"some-token-string"}`.

### Permissions

Camera, Recording Audio and Internet permissions are required. Add them to your manifest.

```xml:AndroidManifest.xml section=Permissions sectionIndex=1
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

You will also need to request Camera and Record Audio permissions at runtime before you join a call or display a preview. Please follow [Android Documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting#request-permission) for runtime permissions.

### Instantiate HMSSDK

Instantiate the HMSSDK like this:

<Tabs id="instanstiate-hmssdk" items={['Kotlin', 'Java']} />

<Tab id='instanstiate-hmssdk-0'>

```kotlin section=InstantiateHMSSDK sectionIndex=1 tab=Kotlin
    val hmsSdk = HMSSDK
        .Builder(application)
        .build()
```

</Tab>

<Tab id='instanstiate-hmssdk-1'>

```java section=InstantiateHMSSDK sectionIndex=1 tab=Java
 HMSSDK hmssdk = new HMSSDK
                        .Builder(application)
                        .build();
```

</Tab>

### Join a Video Call

To join a video call, call the `join` method of `hmssdk` with the config and appropriate listeners.

The main ones to know are:

`onJoin` - called when the join was successful and you have entered the room.

> 💡 Audio will be automatically connected, video requires some work on your side.

`onPeerUpdate` - called when a person joins or leaves the call and when their audio/video mutes/unmutes.

`onTrackUpdate` - usually when a person joins the call, the listener will first call `onPeerUpdate` to notify about the join. Subsequently `onTrackUpdate` will be called with their actual video track.

> 💡It's essential that this callback is listened to or you may have peers without video.

<Tabs id="join-call" items={['Kotlin', 'Java']} />

<Tab id='join-call-0'>

```kotlin section=JoinVideoCall sectionIndex=1 tab=Kotlin

val config = HMSConfig("user display name", authToken)

hmsSdk.join(config, MyHmsUpdateListener())

class MyHmsUpdateListener : HMSUpdateListener {
    override fun onJoin(room: HMSRoom) {}
    override fun onTrackUpdate(type: HMSTrackUpdate, track: HMSTrack, peer: HMSPeer) {}
    override fun onPeerUpdate(type: HMSPeerUpdate, peer: HMSPeer) {}
    override fun onMessageReceived(message: HMSMessage) {}
    override fun onRoleChangeRequest(request: HMSRoleChangeRequest) {}
    override fun onRoomUpdate(type: HMSRoomUpdate, hmsRoom: HMSRoom) {}
    override fun onError(error: HMSException) {}
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab id='join-call-1'>

```java section=JoinVideoCall sectionIndex=1 tab=Java

HMSConfig config = new HMSConfig("user display name", authToken);

hmsSdk.join(config, new MyHmsUpdateListener());

class MyHmsUpdateListener implements HMSUpdateListener {
    @Override public void onJoin(@NonNull HMSRoom hmsRoom) {}
    @Override public void onMessageReceived(@NonNull HMSMessage hmsMessage) {}
    @Override public void onPeerUpdate(@NonNull HMSPeerUpdate hmsPeerUpdate, @NonNull HMSPeer hmsPeer) {}
    @Override public void onReconnected() {}
    @Override public void onReconnecting(@NonNull HMSException e) {}
    @Override public void onRoleChangeRequest(@NonNull HMSRoleChangeRequest hmsRoleChangeRequest) {}
    @Override public void onRoomUpdate(@NonNull HMSRoomUpdate hmsRoomUpdate, @NonNull HMSRoom hmsRoom) {}
    @Override public void onTrackUpdate(@NonNull HMSTrackUpdate hmsTrackUpdate, @NonNull HMSTrack hmsTrack, @NonNull HMSPeer hmsPeer) {}
    @Override public void onError(@NonNull HMSException e) {}
}

```

</Tab>

### How you know when people join or leave

The join method takes an interface called `HMSUpdateListener`. It lets you know when peers join and leave the call, mute/unmute their audio and video and lots more.

The `HMSUpdateListener` has a callback to notify about people joining or leaving. It is `onPeerUpdate(type: HMSPeerUpdate, peer: HMSPeer)`.

> 💡`HMSPeer` is object that represents a person in the call.

### How to render audio and video

The SDK plays the audio for every person who joins the call. Audio will begin playing when join succeeds.
To see the person's video you need to create an instance of `org.webrtc.SurfaceViewRenderer`. The correct version for webrtc is exported via the 100ms android sdk already, so if you have version `2.0.9` and above no additional imports are required to use it.

### Showing Videos

A peer represents one person in the video call.

A peer's video track is in `hmsPeer.videoTrack`. ScreenShares can be found in `val screenShareVideoTrack = hmsPeer.auxiliaryTracks.find { it is HMSVideoTrack }`. i.e the auxiliary tracks is a list of tracks, one of which can be a ScreenShare if they have chosen to share their screen.

You would want a RecyclerView of participants in the video call.
The adapter data should be a list of class that has both the peer and the track to display. Call it a TrackPeerPair.

Your layout xml for a peer video would need to have an `org.webrtc.SurfaceViewRenderer`

```xml section=ShowingVideos sectionIndex=1

<org.webrtc.SurfaceViewRenderer
 android:id="@+id/videoSurfaceView"
 android:layout_width="wrap_content"
 android:layout_height="wrap_content"
 app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="parent"
 app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent" />
```

Initialize this when it's added to the window. Release it when it's removed. Call `hmsPeer.videoTrack?.addSink(surfaceViewRenderer)` to start showing videos.

### Listening to Updates Effectively

Each time there's a an onJoin, onPeerUpdate, or onTrackUpdate, you can add all the peers from `hmsSdk.getPeers()` into the adapter. You'd need to map them into TrackPeerPair's.

## Glossary

-   `Room`: When you join a particular video call, all the peers said to be in a video call `room`'
-   `Track`: Media. Can be the audio track or the video track.
-   `Peer`: One participant in the video call. Local peers are you, remote peers are others.
-   `Broadcast`: Chat messages are broadcasts.
