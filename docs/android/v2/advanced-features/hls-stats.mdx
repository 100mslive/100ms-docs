dependencies {
 // See the version in the badge above.
 // There are separate libraries for the sdk, virtual background and hls-player-stats.
 //     add just the ones you need.
 def hmsVersion = "x.x.x"
 implementation "live.100ms:android-sdk:$hmsVersion"

## Instantiate PlayerEventsCollector

An Existing exoplayer instance can be directly attached to PlayerEventsCollector as follows : 

<Tabs id="instanstiate-PlayerStatsPlugin" items={['Kotlin', 'Java']} />

<Tab id='instanstiate-PlayerStatsPlugin-0'>

```kotlin
            // an existing exoplayer instance
            val exoplayer : Exoplayer 

            // this is an optional configuration provided while instantiated while creating the object, where 
            // @param `eventRate` is the rate in milliseconds at which client wants to recieve the events.(default set to 2000 i.e 2 seconds) 
            val initConfig = InitConfig(eventRate = 2000)

            playerEventsCollector = PlayerEventsCollector(exoplayer : exoplayer)

```

</Tab>

<Tab id='instanstiate-PlayerStatsPlugin-1'>

```java
            // an existing exoplayer instance
            Exoplayer exoplayer; 

            // this is an optional configuration provided while instantiated while creating the object, where 
            // @param `eventRate` is the rate in milliseconds at which client wants to recieve the events.(default set to 2000 i.e 2 seconds) 
            InitConfig initConfig = new InitConfig(2000);

            PlayerEventsCollector playerEventsCollector = PlayerEventsCollector(exoplayer,initConfig);

```

</Tab>

## Listening to updates from PlayerEventsCollector

 To start listeneing updates from the plugin , listener can be attached as follows : 

<Tabs id="addListener-PlayerStatsPlugin" items={['Kotlin', 'Java']} />

<Tab id='addListener-PlayerStatsPlugin-0'>

```kotlin
           playerEventsCollector.addListener(object : PlayerEventsListener {
                override fun onEventUpdate(playerStats: PlayerStats) {
                    // playerStats object contains information for all the stats provided by the plugin.
                    // more information for this object is mentioned at the end of the document.
                }
            })

```

</Tab>

<Tab id='addListener-PlayerStatsPlugin-1'>

```java
            playerEventsCollector.addListener(new PlayerEventsListener() {
                @Override
                public void onEventUpdate(@NonNull PlayerStats playerStats) {
                    
                }
            });
```

</Tab>

 To stop listeneing updates from the plugin , listener can be removed as follows : 

<Tabs id="removeListener-PlayerStatsPlugin" items={['Kotlin', 'Java']} />

<Tab id='removeListener-PlayerStatsPlugin-0'>

```kotlin
            playerEventsCollector.removeListener()

```

</Tab>

<Tab id='removeListener-PlayerStatsPlugin-1'>

```java
            playerEventsCollector.removeListener();

```

</Tab>

<Note>

**Note**

    removeListener() must be called when view listening to it is destroyed

| bytesDownloaded | The total bytes downloaded within the given poll duration | Bytes | Use this to calculate the total Bytes downloaded in a session or to show the network activity |
| bitrate | bitrate of the current layer being played | bytes per second | Use to show a bitrate chart to the user |
| bufferedDuration | An estimate of the total buffered duration from the current position | ms | This can be used to show how much data is already buffered |
| video width | The width of the video  | pixels | Used to know the resolution being played |
| video height | The height of the video | pixels | Used to know the resolution being played |
