title: Show Audio Levels
nav: 5.01

The concepts explained here are:
1. [Getting Audio Levels for all speaking peers](#audio-level).
2. [Creating a UI that shows the loudest speaking users](#active-speaker-views).
3. [Dominant Speaker - the loudest speaker](#dominant-speaker).

## Audio Level

The audio level for every speaking peer is can be retrieved by registering an instance of `HMSAudioListener` in `hmsSDK.addAudioObserver`.

```kotlin
hmsSDK.addAudioObserver(object : HMSAudioListener {
        override fun onAudioLevelUpdate(speakers: Array<HMSSpeaker>) {
          Log.v("TAG",
            "onAudioLevelUpdate: speakers=${speakers.map { Pair(it.peer?.name, it.level) }}"
          )
        }
      })
```

Here's are the properties on the `HMSSpeaker` class:

- trackId : `String`. The track id of the audio track for this speaker.
- level : `Int`. The level of the audio. It may vary from 0-100. A higher value indicates a higher speaking volume.
- hmsTrack : HMSTrack?. The audio track corresponding to this speaker. It may be null when the speaker who was speaking loudly, leaves.
- peer : HMSPeer?. The peer who was speaking. This may be null if the peer has left before the update information has reached the other person.


## Active Speaker Views
To maintain an active speaker view, such as the default view in the [open source advanced sample app](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-android), you need to keep track of who the active speakers are over time.
We'll be using the input from `HMSAudioListener` as mentioned above and then building something that attempts to show all the active speakers while minimizing re-ordering the list.

This is achived in the sample app by means of the [ActiveSpeakerCache](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-android/blob/b02ad19b7ad1bcc3b9973a2a6a4e1a36c121f477/app/src/main/java/live/hms/app2/ui/meeting/activespeaker/ActiveSpeakerCache.kt), [ActiveSpeakerHandler](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-android/blob/b02ad19b7ad1bcc3b9973a2a6a4e1a36c121f477/app/src/main/java/live/hms/app2/ui/meeting/activespeaker/ActiveSpeakerHandler.kt) and then piping the input from the `HMSAudioListener` into the handler as demonstrated [here](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-android/blob/0ebfc6527bafbda7236d5245dedb5fefb262bfcc/app/src/main/java/live/hms/app2/ui/meeting/MeetingViewModel.kt#L126).

## Dominant Speaker


The dominant speaker is the speaker who's the loudest at any given moment.
There's a callback for this in the `onPeerUpdate` callback for `HMSUpdateListener`.

Here's the method signature for onPeerUpdate:
`override fun onPeerUpdate(type: HMSPeerUpdate, hmsPeer: HMSPeer)`

When the dominant speaker has changed, there will be updates of the type:
- `HMSPeerUpdate.BECAME_DOMINANT_SPEAKER`
When a new person becomes the dominant speaker.

- `HMSPeerUpdate.NO_DOMINANT_SPEAKER`
When the current dominant speaker stops talking and there's no one to replace them.

The `hmsPeer` parameter contains the person these updates apply to.
