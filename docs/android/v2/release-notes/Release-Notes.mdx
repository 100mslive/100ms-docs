## 2.1.7 - 2021-11-01

### Changed
The timeouts for all websocket operations on the server have been increased from 5 seconds to 11 seconds.

If a join was failing before for lack of feedback, it has a larger margin within which to succeed now.

## 2.1.6 - 2021-10-28

### Breaking Changes
`requestedBy: HMSPeer` in `HMSChangeTrackStateRequest` is now nullable.
It could be mute if the person tried to mute or unmute someone and immediately left the room.

### Fixed
* Check for Role change of remote peers after reconnection
* Return correct value of isPlaybackAllowed
* HMSTrack is null for local peer in HMSSpeaker
* `onSuccess` callback for the `acceptChangeRequest` method was never being called. This will now be called appropriately.
This request can safely be ignored because the SDK already muted the peer but may be helpful in recognizing that the mute came externally.
A check like the following is now required in your `onChangeTrackStateRequest`:

```kotlin
            if (details.track.isMute != details.mute) {
              // Process ChangeTrackMuteRequest
            }
```

### Added
* Added `customerId` and `description` to HMSPeer's tostring().
* `HMSChangeTrackStateRequest` is now sent even when peers are muted. Previously, if a remote peer requested a peer to mute, there would be no ChangeTrackStateRequest
* The way packet loss is measured for track degradation is  changed
