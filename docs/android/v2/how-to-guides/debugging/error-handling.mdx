When you make an API call to access an HMS SDK, the SDK may return error codes. ErrorCodes are returned when a problem that cannot be recovered without app intervention has occurred.

These are returned as `HMSException` in the `onError` callback of the `HMSUpdateListner`.

Following are the different error codes that are returned by the SDK . Before returning any error code, SDK retries the errors\(whichever is possible\).

| **Error Code** | **Cause of the error**                                 | **Action to be taken**                                                                                      |
