Android SDK provides support for sharing the entire screen of the device to the room.

Please note that for a peer to share their screen, their role must have screenshare enabled in the dashboard. Also select the appropriate resolution that you desire the screenshare track should be of.

## How to start screenshare from the app (without a custom notification)

To start screen share, app needs to call the `startScreenshare` method of `HMSSDK`, which takes in two parameters -
The first one is `HMSActionResultListener` which is a callback object needed to inform about `success`
or `failure` of the action
The second one is a `Intent` which is the result data of MediaProjection permission activity;
the calling app must validate that result code is `Activity.RESULT_OK` before
calling this method.

Following is the snippet on how to use this:

<Tabs id="startscreenshare" items={['Kotlin']} />

<Tab id='startscreenshare-0'>

```kotlin
// Define a result Launcher
  var resultLauncher = registerForActivityResult(ActivityResultContracts.StartActivityForResult()) { result ->
    if (result.resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK) {
      val mediaProjectionPermissionResultData: Intent? = result.data
      // Pass this intent to hmsSDK
      hmsSDK.startScreenshare(object : HMSActionResultListener {
        override fun onError(error: HMSException) {
          // an error occurred
        }

        override fun onSuccess() {
          // started successfully
        }

      } ,mediaProjectionPermissionResultData)
    }
  }

    // Get the MEDIA_PROJECTION_SERVICE and launch the result launcher
    val mediaProjectionManager: MediaProjectionManager? = requireContext().getSystemService(
                Context.MEDIA_PROJECTION_SERVICE
              ) as MediaProjectionManager
    resultLauncher.launch(mediaProjectionManager?.createScreenCaptureIntent())

```

It is important to note that screenshare will not work if the `resultCode` is NOT `Activity.RESULT_OK`.
SDK will also start a foreground service with a notification when screenshare is started, which is mandated above Android 10.

## How to add a custom notification

To take a look at how this is implemented in our sample app, click [here](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-android/blob/3590777bf0a3677cb9b5001034ea9ed7087f9d90/app/src/main/java/live/hms/app2/ui/meeting/MeetingViewModel.kt#L860).

`hmssdk.startScreenShare` also takes an optional third parameter of type notification. See how to build a custom notification in the android docs [here](https://developer.android.com/training/notify-user/build-notification).

It could look something like this:
Since this is a standard Android notification the full range of customization is available.

```kotlin

  fun startScreenshare(mediaProjectionPermissionResultData: Intent?, actionListener: HMSActionResultListener) {
    // Without custom notification
    // hmsSDK.startScreenshare(actionListener ,mediaProjectionPermissionResultData)

    // With custom notification
    val notification = NotificationCompat.Builder(getApplication(), "ScreenCapture channel")
      .setContentText("Screenshare running for roomId: ${hmsRoom?.roomId}")
      .setSmallIcon(R.drawable.arrow_up_float)
      .build()

    hmsSDK.startScreenshare(actionListener, mediaProjectionPermissionResultData, notification)
  }

```

</Tab>

## How to get Screen Share Status

Application needs to call the `isScreenShareActive` method of `HMSSDK`.

This method returns a `Boolean` which will be true inscase ScreenShare is currently active and being used, and False for inactive state.

<Tabs id="screensharestatus" items={['Kotlin']} />

<Tab id='screensharestatus-0'>

```kotlin

  hmsSDK.isScreenShareActive()

```

</Tab>

## How to stop the screenshare and dissmiss the foreground notification from the notification.

To stop the screenshare, create a custom notification and add the following action to it. The image could be anything, but the action has to be gotten from the HMSScreenCaptureService.
This will create a "STOP SCREENSHARE" button on the intent.

This pending intent could be passed anywhere you'd like, including on tap of the notification itself.

```kotlin
val notification = NotificationCompat.Builder(getApplication(), "ScreenCapture channel")
      .addAction(R.drawable.ic_menu_close_clear_cancel, "Stop Screenshare", HMSScreenCaptureService.getStopScreenSharePendingIntent(getApplication()))
      .build()

```

## How to stop screenshare

Application needs to call the `stopScreenshare` method of `HMSSDK` and pass an instance of `HMSActionResultListener` to listen to the callbacks.
SDK also stops the foreground service on calling this method.

<Tabs id="stopscreenshare" items={['Kotlin']} />

<Tab id='stopscreenshare-0'>

```kotlin

      hmsSDK.stopScreenshare(object : HMSActionResultListener {
        override fun onError(error: HMSException) {
          // an error occurred
        }

        override fun onSuccess() {
          // stopped successfully
        }

      } )

```

</Tab>

> It is advisable to call `leave` API from the `onDestroy()` of the `activity`/ `fragment` that

    started the screenshare otherwise the foreground service will be running if even user kills the
    app from the Recents tab.

> DONOT forget to add the permission for foreground service

```kotlin

    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />

```
