What's a video call without being able to send messages to each other too? 100ms supports chat for every video/audio room you create.

You can see an example of every type of message (of the types below) being sent and displayed in the advanced [sample app](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-android/).

### Addressing messages

-   [Broadcast messages](#sending-broadcast-messages) are sent to Everyone in the chat `hmssdk.sendBroadcastMessage`.

-   [Direct messages](#sending-direct-messages) are sent to a specific person `hmssdk.sendDirectMessage`.

-   [Group messages](#sending-group-messages) are sent to everyone with a particular `HMSRole`. Such as all `hosts` or all `teachers` or all `students` `hmsSdk.sendGroupMessage`.
    -   Learn more about [roles](/android/v2/foundation/templates-and-roles) and how to create them on the backend.

### Sending Chat Messages

#### Sending Broadcast Messages

Want to let everyone in the chat know something? Call `sendBroadcastMessage` on the instance of `HMSSDK` to a send a broadcast.

The parameters are:

1. _textMessage_: The text of the message.
2. _type_: The type of the message, default is `HMSMessageType.CHAT`.
3. _hmsMessageResultListener_: An instance of `HMSMessageResultListener`.
    - `onSuccess` will be called when the server receives the request. The `onSuccess` contains a `HMSMessage` which has the updated `serverReceiveTime` a date containing the server timestamp.
    - `onError` will be called with an instance of `HMSException` detailing what went wrong.

> ðŸ’¡ Note that the callback only lets you know if the server has received your request for the message or if there was some error.
>
> It does not convey whether the message was delivered to or read by the recipient.
>
> Also it's important to make a new callback per message because it will only contain the results of that particular call for sending a message.

      }
})

        }

        @Override
        public void onError(@NonNull HMSException e) {

        }
    }
);
```

#### Sending Direct Messages

Got secrets to share? Send a message directly to a single person in the chat with a direct message. Call `sendDirectMessage` on an instance of `HMSSDK`.

The parameters are:

1. _textMessage_: The text of the message.
2. _type_: The type of the message, default is `HMSMessageType.CHAT`.
3. _peerTo_: The `HMSPeer` instance who should receive message.
4. _hmsMessageResultListener_: An instance of `HMSMessageResultListener`.
    - `onSuccess` will be called when the server receives the request. The `onSuccess` contains a `HMSMessage` which has the updated `serverReceiveTime` a date containing the server timestamp.
    - `onError` will be called with an instane of `HMSException` detailing what went wrong.

                }

    });
}

```

### Receiving Chat Messages

When you called `hmsSdk.join(config, hmsUpdateListener)` to join a room, the `HMSUpdateListener` implementation that was passed in had the callback `fun onMessageReceived(message: HMSMessage)`.

This where you'll receive new messages as `HMSMessage` during the call. It contains:

```kotlin

data class HMSMessage internal constructor(
  val message: String,
  val type: String,
  val recipient: HMSMessageRecipient = HMSMessageRecipient(),
  var serverReceiveTime: Date,
  var sender: HMSPeer
  val messageId: String
)
```

-   message: Content of the text message or the text description of the raw message.
-   type: Type of message sent. Default value is `HMSMessageType.CHAT`.
-   recipient: The intended recipient(s) of this message as a `HMSMessageRecipient`.
-   serverReceiveTime: timestamp of when the messaging server receives this message. Update the time in your own messages when this comes back from the server in `HMSUpdateListener.onMessageReceived` for accurate ordering of your own messages.
-   sender: The `HMSPeer` who is sending this message.
-   messageId: A unique ID assigned by the server which identifies this message.

Identifying Messages:

Use the `messageId` an attribute which will be in:
1. Remote Messaages: `onMessageReceived(message: HMSMessage)` of `HMSUpdateListener`.
2. Local Messages: The `onMessageonSuccess(hmsMessage: HMSMessage)` callback of the `HMSMessageResultListener` while sending any kind of message.

Identifying Senders:

The sender of a message is always contained in the `sender` field of HMSMessage. This lets you get the name and peer id for any message sender.

Message Body:

The body of the message is in `message` as a String.

Time:

The time the message was sent is contained in `time` as a Java Date.

### Putting together a list of chat messages.

The UI is completely up to you to decide! You'll also need to hold onto all the received messages if you want to display history.

#### Identifying who the message was for

The HMSMessageRecipient contained in the `recipient` field of `HMSMessage` lets you know who the message was for.

The `HMSMessageRecipient` contains:

```kotlin
class HMSMessageRecipient internal constructor(
    var recipientPeer: HMSPeer? = null,
    var recipientRoles: List<HMSRole> = mutableListOf(),
    var recipientType: HMSMessageRecipientType : HMSMessageRecipientType
)
```

recipientPeer: Only contains a peer when a specific single peer is being direct messaged.

recipientRoles: Only contains values when a group message is being sent to many roles.

recipientType: Will be `HMSMessageRecipientType.BROADCAST` for a message being sent to everyone. If this is true, the other two fields will be null and empty respectively.

`HMSMessageRecipientType.PEER` will be set when it's a direct message.

`HMSMessageRecipientType.ROLES` will be set when it's a message to one or many roles.

A good way to map this to your own app is a class like `Recipient` below. You could choose to copy this file into your code for the mapping.

```kotlin{17-23}:RecipientMapping.kt

sealed class Recipient {

    object Everyone : Recipient() {
        override fun toString(): String = "Everyone"
    }

    data class Role(val role : HMSRole) : Recipient() {
        override fun toString(): String =
            role.name
    }

    data class Peer(val peer : HMSPeer) : Recipient() {
        override fun toString(): String = peer.name
    }

    companion object {
        fun toRecipient(message : HMSMessageRecipient) : Recipient =
            when(message.recipientType) {
                HMSMessageRecipientType.BROADCAST -> Everyone
                HMSMessageRecipientType.PEER -> Peer(message.recipientPeer!!)
                HMSMessageRecipientType.ROLES -> Role(message.recipientRoles.firstOrNull()!!)
        }
    }
}
```

So that if you need to convert the message to your own class you can set the recipient like:

```kotlin{7}
override fun onMessageReceived(message: HMSMessage) {
    ChatMessage(
        message.sender.name,
        message.serverReceiveTime,
        message.message,
        false,
        recipient = Recipient.toRecipient(message.recipient)
    )
}
```
