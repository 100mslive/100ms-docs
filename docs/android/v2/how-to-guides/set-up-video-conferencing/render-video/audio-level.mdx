title: Show Audio Levels

The concepts explained here are:

1. [Getting Audio Levels for all speaking peers](#audio-level).
2. [Creating a UI that shows the loudest speaking users](#active-speaker-views).
3. [Dominant Speaker - the loudest speaker](#dominant-speaker).

## Audio Level

The audio level for every speaking peer can be retrieved by registering an instance of `HMSAudioListener` in `hmsSDK.addAudioObserver` like so.

<Tabs id="add-audio-observer" items={['Kotlin', 'Java']} />

<Tab id='add-audio-observer-0'>

```kotlin
hmsSDK.addAudioObserver(object : HMSAudioListener {
        override fun onAudioLevelUpdate(speakers: Array<HMSSpeaker>) {
          Log.v("TAG",
                  "Active Speakers are: ${speakers.map { s -> "${s.peer?.name} ${s.level}" }}}"
          )
        }
      })

```

</Tab>

<Tab id='add-audio-observer-1'>

```java
hmsSdk.addAudioObserver(new HMSAudioListener() {
            @Override
            public void onAudioLevelUpdate(@NonNull HMSSpeaker[] hmsSpeakers) {
                StringBuilder allSpeakers = new StringBuilder("Active speakers are: ");
                for( HMSSpeaker speaker : hmsSpeakers) {
                  String name;
                  if(speaker.getPeer() != null ) {
                    name = speaker.getPeer().getName()
                  } else {
                    name = ""
                  }
                    allSpeakers.append(name)
                        .append(" ")
                        .append(speaker.getLevel())
                        .append("\n");
                }
                Log.d("tag", allSpeakers.toString());
            }
        });
```

</Tab>

Here are the properties on the `HMSSpeaker` class:

-   trackId : `String`. The track id of the audio track for this speaker.
-   level : `Int`. The level of the audio. It may vary from 0-100. A higher value indicates a higher speaking volume.
-   hmsTrack : HMSTrack?. The audio track corresponding to this speaker. It may be null when the speaker who was speaking loudly, leaves.
-   peer : HMSPeer?. The peer who was speaking. This may be null if the peer has left before the update information has reached the other person.

## Active Speaker Views

To maintain an active speaker view, such as the default view in the [open source advanced sample app](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-android), you need to keep track of who the active speakers are over time.
We'll be using the input from `HMSAudioListener` as mentioned above and then building something that attempts to show all the active speakers while minimizing re-ordering the list.

This is achived in the sample app by means of the [ActiveSpeakerCache](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-android/blob/b02ad19b7ad1bcc3b9973a2a6a4e1a36c121f477/app/src/main/java/live/hms/app2/ui/meeting/activespeaker/ActiveSpeakerCache.kt), [ActiveSpeakerHandler](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-android/blob/b02ad19b7ad1bcc3b9973a2a6a4e1a36c121f477/app/src/main/java/live/hms/app2/ui/meeting/activespeaker/ActiveSpeakerHandler.kt) and then piping the input from the `HMSAudioListener` into the handler as demonstrated [here](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-android/blob/0ebfc6527bafbda7236d5245dedb5fefb262bfcc/app/src/main/java/live/hms/app2/ui/meeting/MeetingViewModel.kt#L126).

## Dominant Speaker

The dominant speaker is the speaker who's the loudest at any given moment.
There's a callback for this in the `onPeerUpdate` callback for `HMSUpdateListener`.

Here's the method signature for onPeerUpdate:
`override fun onPeerUpdate(type: HMSPeerUpdate, hmsPeer: HMSPeer)`

When the dominant speaker has changed, there will be updates of the type:

-   `HMSPeerUpdate.BECAME_DOMINANT_SPEAKER`
    When a new person becomes the dominant speaker.

-   `HMSPeerUpdate.NO_DOMINANT_SPEAKER`
    When the current dominant speaker stops talking and there's no one to replace them.

The `hmsPeer` parameter contains the person these updates apply to.
