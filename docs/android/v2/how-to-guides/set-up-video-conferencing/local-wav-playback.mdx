title: Local WAV Audio Playback 
nav: 4.8
---

This feature enables your application to play audio from a WAV file stored in your app's raw resources. It is a strict requirement that the WAV file is 48kHz, mono channel with 16-bit audio depth for the audio to be played correctly.

## How Does WAV Audio Playback Work
The provided API offers two simple methods:

- Play Audio: Streams and plays a WAV audio file.
- Stop Audio: Stops the currently playing audio.

Make sure that your WAV file complies with the required specifications (48kHz, mono, 16-bit). Placing a non-compliant file may result in playback issues.

## How to Stream and Play a WAV File
To start playing a WAV file, add your compliant WAV file to the res/raw folder of your project. Then, use the following API method:

```kotlin
Copy
fun streamAndPlayAudioFromRawFile(
    @androidx.annotation.RawRes audioResourceId: Int,
    hmsActionResultListener: HMSActionResultListener
) {
    transportLayer.streamAndPlayAudioFromRawFile(audioResourceId, hmsActionResultListener)
}
```
Below is an example snippet that demonstrates how to call this API:

<Tabs id="playaudiotab" items={['Kotlin']} />

<Tab id='playaudiotab-0'>
```kotlin
Copy
// Replace R.raw.your_wav_file with the actual WAV file placed in res/raw
hmsSDK.streamAndPlayAudioFromRawFile(R.raw.your_wav_file, object : HMSActionResultListener {
    override fun onSuccess() {
        // Audio started playing successfully
    }

    override fun onError(error: HMSException) {
        // Handle the error
    }
})
```
</Tab>
## How to Stop the Audio Playback
To stop the audio playback at any time, simply call the following method:

```kotlin
Copy
fun stopAudioFromRawFile(hmsActionResultListener: HMSActionResultListener) {
    transportLayer.stopAudioFromRawFile(hmsActionResultListener)
}
```
Below is a sample snippet demonstrating how to stop the audio playback:

<Tabs id="stopaudiotab" items={['Kotlin']} />

<Tab id='stopaudiotab-0'>
```kotlin
Copy
hmsSDK.stopAudioFromRawFile(object : HMSActionResultListener {
    override fun onSuccess() {
        // Audio stopped successfully
    }

    override fun onError(error: HMSException) {
        // Handle the error
    }
})
```
</Tab>
Note: Ensure your WAV file adheres to the strict format of 48kHz, mono channel, 16-bit audio depth. Using files with different specifications might result in unexpected behavior or failure in audio playback.
