## Pre Call Diagnostic APIs

The Pre Call Diagnostic APIs provide two type of functionality :
1. APIs to test connected I/O devices like camera, mic and speaker functionality
2. APIs to test connectivity to the 100ms Servers - This can identify signaling and media connectivity issues and provide a report at the end of the test.

You can use these APIs in your application to detect issues before a Participant joins a video Room or as part of a troubleshooting page while already joined in the room or at a later stage to debug some issues at the end user device/network

## How to use the Pre Call Diagnostic APIs

To use the diagnostic apis first you need to get an instance of `HMSDiagnostics` from the `HMSSDK` instance.
<Tabs id="instantiate-HMSDiagnostic" items={['Kotlin']} />
<Tab id='instantiate-HMSDiagnostic-0'>

```kotlin
            // get the HMSSDK instance
            val hmsSDK = HMSSDK.Builder(application).build()

            // user id can be null as well
            val diagnosticsSDK =  hmsSDK.getDiagnosticsSDK("user-id")

```

</Tab>
If you are planning to use the connectivity checks while you have already joined a room, create a new instance of `HMSSDK` to get the `HMSDiagnostic` instance

## Test microphone

To test if the microphone is correctly working, call the `startMicCheck` API. Diagnostics SDK will open the microphone in recording mode and record the stream captured into a file in the cache memory.
`onSuccess` callback will be called if SDK is able to open the microphone and start recording
`onAudioLevelChanged` is called every second with the decibel level detected by the microphone. This can be used on the UI to show an indication that mic is listening to user's audio
`onError` is called in case there was any issue while starting the microphone or if permission not given

Ensure to give the microphone permission before calling this

<Tabs id="HMSDiagnostic-checkMicrophone" items={['Kotlin']} />
<Tab id='HMSDiagnostic-checkMicrophone-0'>

```kotlin
            // get the diagnostic instance
            val diagnosticsSDK =  hmsSDK.getDiagnosticsSDK("user-id")

            diagnosticsSDK.startMicCheck(getApplication<Application>(), object :
                        HMSAudioDeviceCheckListener {
                        override fun onError(error: HMSException) {
                            // This will be called if there any error while recording
                        }

                        override fun onSuccess() {

                        }

                        override fun onAudioLevelChanged(decibel: Int) {


                        }

                    })

```

</Tab>

The recording will continue un-till `stopMicCheck` is called. Ensure to call this method, otherwise the mic will be not be released by the SDK
<Tabs id="HMSDiagnostic-stopMicCheck" items={['Kotlin']} />
<Tab id='HMSDiagnostic-stopMicCheck-0'>

```kotlin
            // get the diagnostic instance
            val diagnosticsSDK =  hmsSDK.getDiagnosticsSDK("user-id")

            diagnosticsSDK.stopMicCheck()

```

</Tab>

## Test speaker
To test the device speaker phone, call the `startSpeakerTest` API. This will playback the file that was recorded while testing mic.
If there is no recorded file present in the cache, either due to microphone issues or `startMicCheck` not being called, the speaker test API will play a pre-recorded file

You can check if the speaker is working correctly if you are able to properly listen to the recording from `startMicCheck` API or the pre recorded file
<Tabs id="HMSDiagnostic-startSpeakerCheck" items={['Kotlin']} />

<Tab id='HMSDiagnostic-startSpeakerCheck-0'>

```kotlin
            // get the diagnostic instance
            val diagnosticsSDK =  hmsSDK.getDiagnosticsSDK("user-id")

            diagnosticsSDK.startSpeakerCheck()

```

</Tab>

To stop the speaker check, call the `stopSpeakerCheck` API. This will release any resources that the SDK might be holding while playing back
<Tabs id="HMSDiagnostic-stopSpeakerCheck" items={['Kotlin']} />

<Tab id='HMSDiagnostic-stopSpeakerCheck-0'>

```kotlin
            // get the diagnostic instance
            val diagnosticsSDK =  hmsSDK.getDiagnosticsSDK("user-id")

            diagnosticsSDK.stopSpeakerCheck()

```

</Tab>

## Test Camera
To check if the camera on the device is working fine, call the `startCameraCheck` API. This API creates a local video track and returns it. Incase there are any issues with the camera module it will be sent in the `onError` callback of the `HMSCameraCheckListener`
Applications can use `HMSVideoView` to show the video track to users, using the same way any other `HMSVideoTrack` is shown.startMicCheck
This API takes the `CameraFacing` as a parameter, where you can specify either the FRONT or REAR camera. By default FRONT camera is chosen.

<Tabs id="HMSDiagnostic-startCameraCheck" items={['Kotlin']} />

<Tab id='HMSDiagnostic-startCameraCheck-0'>

```kotlin
            // get the diagnostic instance
            val diagnosticsSDK =  hmsSDK.getDiagnosticsSDK("user-id")

            diagnosticsSDK.startCameraCheck(HMSVideoTrackSettings.CameraFacing.FRONT,
               object : HMSCameraCheckListener {
                   override fun onError(error: HMSException) {
                        // Error in opening or getting frames from camera
                   }

                   override fun onVideoTrack(localVideoTrack: HMSVideoTrack) {
                       // Show this track on a HMSVideoView
                   }
               })

```
</Tab>

To stop the camera check and release all the resources, call `stopCameraCheck` API
<Tabs id="HMSDiagnostic-stopCameraCheck" items={['Kotlin']} />

<Tab id='HMSDiagnostic-stopCameraCheck-0'>

```kotlin
            // get the diagnostic instance
            val diagnosticsSDK =  hmsSDK.getDiagnosticsSDK("user-id")

            diagnosticsSDK.stopCameraCheck()

```
</Tab>

## Test Connectivity to 100ms Servers
To test if there is proper connectivity to 100ms signalling and media servers, you have to call the `startConnectivityCheck` API. This API establishes connections to both the signalling an media server and publishes audio and video data to determine the network quality and generates a report of the connection.
This API uses the local device's mic and camera to send audio-video data and receives back the same data to calculate network stats for both upload and download link of user's network.
Please note that Camera and microphone permissions are needed to be provided by the app before making a call to this API
This test runs for 20 seconds. It may finish earlier if connection cannot be established.

While the connectivity test is being performed, regular updates are sent by the SDK via the `onConnectivityStateChanged` callback. The application can listen to these updates and notify the UI to show updates regarding the test.
When the test is completed, `onCompleted` callback is sent to the application with the complete `ConnectivityCheckResult` that has details about all the reports generated.

<Tabs id="HMSDiagnostic-startConnectivityCheck" items={['Kotlin']} />

<Tab id='HMSDiagnostic-startConnectivityCheck-0'>

```kotlin
            // get the diagnostic instance
            val diagnosticsSDK =  hmsSDK.getDiagnosticsSDK("user-id")

            diagnosticsSDK.startConnectivityCheck(regionCode,
                        object : live.hms.video.diagnostics.ConnectivityCheckListener {
                            override fun onCompleted(result: ConnectivityCheckResult) {
                                // called after the connectivity
                            }
                            override fun onConnectivityStateChanged(state: ConnectivityState) {
                                // Updates about the test being performed.
                            }
                        })

```
</Tab>

## Understanding ConnectivityState updates
The `startConnectivityCheck` API sends regular updates while the test is going on. `ConnectivityState` is an enum which has the following states:
<Tabs id="HMSDiagnostic-ConnectivityState" items={['Kotlin']} />

<Tab id='HMSDiagnostic-ConnectivityState-0'>

```kotlin
           enum class ConnectivityState {
               STARTING,
               INIT_FETCHED,
               SIGNAL_CONNECTED,
               ICE_ESTABLISHED,
               MEDIA_CAPTURED,
               MEDIA_PUBLISHED,
               COMPLETED
           }

```
