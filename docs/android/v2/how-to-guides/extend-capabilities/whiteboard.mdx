## Introduction

The Android SDK provided by 100ms offers support for starting and stopping a whiteboard feature using a `WebView`. 
This feature allows users to collaborate on a shared digital whiteboard in real-time. However, it's important to note that for a user to be able to start or view the whiteboard, 
their role must have the whiteboard functionality enabled in the 100ms dashboard.

## Supported Versions

-   Minimum 100ms SDK version it can work with is `2.9.53`

## WebView configuration for whiteboard

To make sure whiteboard work correctly with android's `WebView` the follwing configuration needs to be added.

```kotlin

webview.apply {
  settings?.javaScriptEnabled = true
  settings?.domStorageEnabled = true
}

```



# Listen for whiteboard updates

When the `HMSWhiteboardUpdateListener` is triggered, it will receive an instance of `HMSWhiteboardUpdate`, which can be one of two types:

- `HMSWhiteboardUpdate.Start`: Indicates that the whiteboard has been started.
- `HMSWhiteboardUpdate.Stop`: Indicates that the whiteboard has been stopped.

```kotlin

val hmsSDK = HMSSDK
    .Builder(application) //application context
    .build()

//setting up whiteboard listener.
hmsSDK.getHmsInteractivityCenter().setWhiteboardUpdateListener(object : HMSWhiteboardUpdateListener {
    override fun onUpdate(hmsWhiteboardUpdate: HMSWhiteboardUpdate) {
        when(hmsWhiteboardUpdate) {
            is HMSWhiteboardUpdate.Start -> //handle start
            is HMSWhiteboardUpdate.Stop -> //handle stop
        }
    }
})

```

## Start whiteboard update

When the `HMSWhiteboardUpdateListener` receives an instance of `HMSWhiteboardUpdate.Start`, it indicates that the whiteboard has been started. 
In this case, you can load the `url` from `HMSWhiteboard` class into a Webview. This will render the whiteboard on the webview.

## Stop whiteboard update

When the `HMSWhiteboardUpdateListener` receives an instance of `HMSWhiteboardUpdate.Stop`, it indicates that the whiteboard has been stopped. 
In this case, you can implement the necessary logic to handle the stop of the whiteboard, such as hiding the webview visibility.

## HMSWhiteboard model 

`HMSWhiteboard` model is returned on both start/stop of the `HMSWhiteboardUpdate`. The model contains information releated to the current whiteboard in the session.

### Properties
- `id`: A unique identifier for the whiteboard session.
- `title`: The title or name of the whiteboard session
- `owner`: The HMSPeer object representing the owner of the whiteboard session. This property can be null if the owner information is not available.
- `isOwner`: A boolean flag indicating whether the current user has started the whiteboard session.
- `isAdmin`: A boolean flag indicating whether the current user can start/stop the whiteboard session.
- `url`: The link to the whiteboard session.
- `isOpen`: A boolean flag indicating whether the whiteboard session is currently open and active.


# Starting/Stopping whiteboard

## Starting whiteboard
To start a whiteboard, ensure that the role has the appropriate permission and the current whiteboard is not already open.
The callback will be sent to `setWhiteboardUpdateListener()`.

```kotlin
val currentWhiteBoardModel : HMSWhiteboard?  = //you can get HMSWhiteboard model from HMSWhiteboardUpdate

//make sure you the current whiteboard is not opened by someone else 
if (currentWhiteBoardModel?.isOpen == true && currentWhiteBoardModel.isOwner.not())
return


if (currentWhiteBoardModel == null || currentWhiteBoardModel?.isOpen == false) {
  localHmsInteractivityCenter.startWhiteboard(
    title = <Add your whiteboard title>,
    object : HMSActionResultListener {
      override fun onError(error: HMSException) {}
      override fun onSuccess() {}
    })
}
```

## Stopping whiteboard

To stop currently opened whiteboard make sure the role has appropriate permission and the current whiteboard session is opened by the user.
The callback will be sent to `setWhiteboardUpdateListener()`.


```kotlin

val currentWhiteBoardModel : HMSWhiteboard?  = //you can get HMSWhiteboard model from HMSWhiteboardUpdate

//early exit if the whiteboard is already closed and the peer didn't start the whiteboard
if (currentWhiteBoardModel?.isOpen == true && currentWhiteBoardModel.isOwner.not())
return

if (currentWhiteBoardModel?.isOpen == true) {
  localHmsInteractivityCenter.stopWhiteboard(object : HMSActionResultListener{
    override fun onError(error: HMSException) {}
    override fun onSuccess() {}
  })
}

```

If the `isOwner` is true in `HMSWhiteboard` model then user has to refresh and close the `WebiView` to make the whiteboard session stop.

```kotlin 
 webview?.loadUrl(")
```
