title: Noise Cancellation
nav: 14.2

100ms offers noise cancellation at the mic if you need it. This removes noise from outgoing audio.

It supports the same `minSdk` as the core HMS SDK which is 21 (Android 5.0, Lollipop).

The noise cancellation is opt-in, here are the steps to enable it:
1. Add the following import to your app 
```kotlin 
implementation "live.100ms:hms-noise-cancellation-android:$hmsVersion"
```
2. Toggle noise cancellation on in your application with `hmsSDK.setNoiseCancellationEnabled(true)` in your `onJoin` callback.

<Note type='warning'>
**IMPORTANT** <br/>
Enable Noise Cancellation in the template configuration. Learn more on enabling this feature from [here](/get-started/v2/get-started/features/noise-cancellation#enabling-the-noise-cancellation)
</Note>

> Note: Adding the library for noise cancellation will increase app size by 5.6 Mb.  
Noise cancellation is turned off by default for all calls.

## How to Join with Noise cancellation Enabled
To enable noise cancellation by default, add the option in the audio track settings while constucting the `HMSSDK` object.

This is the same as enabling noise cancellation in your `onJoin` callback as seen above.

```kotlin
private val hmsTrackSettings = HMSTrackSettings.Builder()
        .audio(
            HMSAudioTrackSettings.Builder()
                .enableNoiseCancellation(true)
                .build()
        )

    val hmsSDK = HMSSDK
        .Builder(application)
        .setTrackSettings(hmsTrackSettings)
        .build()
```

```java
HMSAudioTrackSettings audioSettings = new HMSAudioTrackSettings.Builder()
                .enableNoiseCancellation(true)
                .build();
                
HMSTrackSettings hmsTrackSettings = new HMSTrackSettings.Builder()
        .audio(audioSettings)
        .build();

HMSSDK hmsSdk = new HMSSDK.Builder(application)
        .setTrackSettings(hmsTrackSettings)
        .build();
```

## How to Enable and Disable Noise Cancellation After Joining
Noise cancellation can be turned on or off dynamically. When starting calls it is always *off* by default.

Toggle it on or off during a call with:
```kotlin
val ncEnabled = true  // or false
hmsSDK.enableNoiseCancellation(ncEnabled, object : HMSActionResultListener {
    override fun onSuccess() {
        // was successful
    }

    override fun onError(error: HMSException) {
        // was an error, read error.message to see what
    }
})
```
> It's encouraged to check for success especially if it's the first time you're integrating.

To get the current state of noise cancellation call:
```kotlin
val enabled : Boolean = hmsSDK.isNoiseCancellationEnabled()
```

## Availability
To debug issues with noise cancellation call `hmsSDK.isNoiseCancellationSupported()`

This will either return `AvailabilityStatus.Available` or it will return `AvailabilityStatus.NotAvailable(val reason : String)`

To see the reason why it's not available, check the reason provided in `NotAvailable`.
Possible reasons may be:
1. The noise cancellation import was not added.

```kotlin
val availability : AvailabilityStatus = hmsSDK.isNoiseCancellationSupported()

if(availability == AvailabilityStatus.Available) {
    /// is available, but not necessarily enabled
} else {
    val reason = (availability as AvailabilityStatus.NotAvailable).reason
    Log.d("NoiseCancellation","Not available because of $reason")
}

```
