title: Noise Cancellation

100ms offers noise cancellation at the mic if you need it.

The noise cancellation is opt-in, here are the steps to enable it:
1. Add the following import to your app 
```kotlin 
implementation "live.100ms:hms-noise-cancellation-android:$hmsVersion"
```
2. Enable noise cancellation from the dashboard.
3. Toggle noise cancellation on in your application with `hmsSDK.setNoiseCancellationEnabled(true)` in your `onJoin` callback.

> Note: Adding the library for noise cancellation will increase app size by 5.6 Mb.  
Noise cancellation is turned off by default for all calls.

## Dynamic Toggling
Noise cancellation can be turned on or off dynamically. When starting calls it is always *off* by default.

Toggle it on or off during a call with:
```kotlin
hmsSDK.setNoiseCancellationEnabled(true) // or false
```

To get the current state of noise cancellation call:
```kotlin
val enabled : Boolean = hmsSDK.getNoiseCancellationEnabled()
```

## Availability
To debug issues with noise cancellation call `hmsSDK.isNoiseCancellationSupported()`

This will either return `AvailabilityStatus.Available` or it will return `AvailabilityStatus.NotAvailable(val reason : String)`

To see the reason why it's not available, check the reason provided in `NotAvailable`.
Possible reasons may be:
1. The noise cancellation import was not added.
2. Noise cancellation is not enabled from the dashboard.

```kotlin
val availability : AvailabilityStatus = hmsSDK.isNoiseCancellationSupported()

if(availability == AvailabilityStatus.Available) {
    /// is available, but not necessarily enabled
} else {
    val reason = (availability as AvailabilityStatus.NotAvailable).reason
    Log.d("NoiseCancellation","Not available because of $reason")
}

```
