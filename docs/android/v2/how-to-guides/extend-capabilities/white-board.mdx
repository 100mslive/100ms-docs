## Introduction

Android SDK provides support for starting/stopping whiteboard using webview.

The Android SDK provided by 100ms offers support for starting and stopping a whiteboard feature using a WebView. 
This feature allows users to collaborate on a shared digital whiteboard in real-time. However, it's important to note that for a user to be able to start or view the whiteboard, 
their role must have the whiteboard functionality enabled in the 100ms dashboard.

## Supported Versions

-   Minimum 100ms SDK version it can work with is `2.9.53`

## Intialising WebView

To make sure whiteboard work correctly with android's webview the follwing configuration needs to be added.

```kotlin

webview.apply {
  settings?.javaScriptEnabled = true
  settings?.domStorageEnabled = true
}

```

# Handling whiteboard updates

When the `HMSWhiteboardUpdateListener` is triggered, it will receive an instance of `HMSWhiteboardUpdate`, which can be one of two types:

- `HMSWhiteboardUpdate.Start`: Indicates that the whiteboard has been started.
- `HMSWhiteboardUpdate.Stop`: Indicates that the whiteboard has been stopped.

```kotlin

val hmsSDK = HMSSDK
    .Builder(application) //application context
    .build()

hmsSDK.getHmsInteractivityCenter().setWhiteboardUpdateListener(object : HMSWhiteboardUpdateListener {
    override fun onUpdate(hmsWhiteboardUpdate: HMSWhiteboardUpdate) {
        when(hmsWhiteboardUpdate) {
            is HMSWhiteboardUpdate.Start -> //handle start
            is HMSWhiteboardUpdate.Stop -> //handle stop
        }
    }
})

```

## Start Whiteboard update

When the `HMSWhiteboardUpdateListener` receives an instance of `HMSWhiteboardUpdate.Start`, it indicates that the whiteboard has been started. 
In this case, you can load the `url` from `HMSWhiteboard` class into a Webview. This will render the whiteboard on the webview.

## Stop Whiteboard update

When the `HMSWhiteboardUpdateListener` receives an instance of `HMSWhiteboardUpdate.Stop`, it indicates that the whiteboard has been stopped. 
In this case, you can implement the necessary logic to handle the stop of the whiteboard, such as hiding the webview visibility.

## HMSWhiteboard model 

`HMSWhiteboard` model is returned on both start/stop of the `HMSWhiteboardUpdate`. The model contains information releated to the current whiteboard in the seesion.

### Properties
- `id`: A unique identifier for the whiteboard session.
- `title`: The title or name of the whiteboard session
- `owner`: The HMSPeer object representing the owner of the whiteboard session. This property can be null if the owner information is not available.
- `isOwner`: A boolean flag indicating whether the current user has started the whiteboard session.
- `isAdmin`: A boolean flag indicating whether the current user can start/stop the whiteboard session.
- `url`: The link to the whiteboard session.
- `isOpen`: A boolean flag indicating whether the whiteboard session is currently open and active.
