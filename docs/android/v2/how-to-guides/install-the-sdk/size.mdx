title: SDK Size Impact
nav: 3.4
---
There are several libraries provided for 100ms-android. Generally the SDK core is required for doing anything with meetings and you can add each individual library if you want it.

Each library has its own size impact that can vary been ABIs (x86, arm64-v8a etc), the table below lists them all.

These sizes are calculated by building release versions of ABI split APKs from the same project, and then subtracting the size of the same project without any 100ms libraries added.

You can take a look at the reference project [here](https://github.com/100mslive/Android-Size-Reference-App/)

These are accurate for sdk version `2.9.59` and room-kit version `1.2.13`.

## Increase in Android APK size:

|  Phone Architecture     	|  Room Kit   |
| --------------------------------- | ---------  |
| (armeabi-v7)                      | **10.9MB**  |
| (arm64-v8a) **(most common one)** | **11.8MB**  |
| (x86_64)                          | **12.7MB**  |
| (x86)                             | **12.5MB**  |

The base `room-kit` already includes the following libraries:

- `android-sdk`
- `video-view`
- `hls-player`
- `video-filters`

To add, for instance `noise-cancellation`, take a look at the table below.

## SDK and each add on library
> Note: Most SDK add on libraries cannot be used without the sdk.
