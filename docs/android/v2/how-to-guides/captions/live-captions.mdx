You can implement captions (subtitles) in your android conferencing app easily with 100ms SDK. The SDK provides a callback with transcript for each peer when they speak.

## Minimum Requirements

-   Minimum 100ms SDK version required is `2.9.54`

## What are captions?

Captions are automatic subtitles that are generated with an AI model, and provided to your app with a easy to implement callback.

## How to implement captions?

Implement `fun onTranscripts(transcripts: HmsTranscripts)` in the `HMSUpdateListener` callback.

For an example implementation look at [`TranscriptionUseCase.kt`](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-android/blob/ac66fa76503ec990322c293f8ce6a504c0c3c444/room-kit/src/main/java/live/hms/roomkit/ui/meeting/TranscriptionUseCase.kt#L44) in the 100ms-android [sample app](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-android/blob/ac66fa76503ec990322c293f8ce6a504c0c3c444/room-kit/src/main/java/live/hms/roomkit/ui/meeting/TranscriptionUseCase.kt#L44) repo.
