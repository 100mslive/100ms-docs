title: Screen Share (Beta)
nav: 12

Android SDK provides support for sharing the entire screen of the device to the room.

Please note that for a peer to share their screen, their role must have screenshare enabled in the dashboard. Also select the appropriate resolution that you desire the screenshare track should be of.

## How to start screenshare from the app
To start screen share, app needs to call the `startScreenshare` method of `HMSSDK`, which takes in two parameters -
    The first one is `HMSActionResultListener` which is a callback object needed to inform about `success`
        or `failure` of the action
    The second one is a `Intent` which is the result data of MediaProjection permission activity;
    the calling app must validate that result code is `Activity.RESULT_OK` before
    calling this method.

Following is the snippet on how to use this:

<Tabs id="startscreenshare" items={['Kotlin']} />

<Tab id='startscreenshare-0'>

```kotlin
// Define a result Launcher
  var resultLauncher = registerForActivityResult(ActivityResultContracts.StartActivityForResult()) { result ->
    if (result.resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK) {
      val mediaProjectionPermissionResultData: Intent? = result.data
      // Pass this intent to hmsSDK
      hmsSDK.startScreenshare(object : HMSActionResultListener {
        override fun onError(error: HMSException) {
          // an error occurred
        }

        override fun onSuccess() {
          // started successfully
        }

      } ,mediaProjectionPermissionResultData)
    }
  }

// Get the MEDIA_PROJECTION_SERVICE and launch the result launcher
    val mediaProjectionManager: MediaProjectionManager? = requireContext().getSystemService(
                Context.MEDIA_PROJECTION_SERVICE
              ) as MediaProjectionManager
    resultLauncher.launch(mediaProjectionManager?.createScreenCaptureIntent())

```

</Tab>

It is important to note that screenshare will not work if the `resultCode` is NOT `Activity.RESULT_OK`.
SDK will also start a foreground service with a notification when screenshare is started, which is mandated above Android 10.

## How to stop screenshare

Application needs to call the `stopScreenshare` method of `HMSSDK` and pass an instance of `HMSActionResultListener` to listen to the callbacks.
SDK also stops the foreground service on calling this method.

<Tabs id="stopscreenshare" items={['Kotlin']} />

<Tab id='stopscreenshare-0'>

```kotlin

      hmsSDK.stopScreenshare(object : HMSActionResultListener {
        override fun onError(error: HMSException) {
          // an error occurred
        }

        override fun onSuccess() {
          // started successfully
        }

      } )

```

</Tab>

Note :-
    `stopScreenshare` should also be called from `onDestroy()` of the `activity`/ `fragment` that is
    starting the screenshare otherwise the foreground service will be running if even user kills the
    app from the Recents tab.
