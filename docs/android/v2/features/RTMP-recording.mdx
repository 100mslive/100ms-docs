title: RTMP streaming / Recording
nav: 13

Want to preserve your video call for posterity in a recording? Or live stream it out to millions of viewers on twitch or youtube or whatever gives you an RTMP injest URL?

Turn on RTMP streaming or recording!

In 100ms, recording and streaming is usually achieved by having a bot join your room and stream what it sees and hears to a file (recording) or to an rtmp injest url (streaming).

# Starting streaming / recording
To start recording, streaming or both, create an instance of `HMSRecordingConfig`.

`HMSRecordingConfig` takes the following:
1. **meetingUrl**: *String*. The url the 100ms bot user will open to join your room. It must allow access without any user level interaction.
2. **rtmpUrls**: *List<String\>*. If streaming is required, this has to be one or more RTMP Injest Urls where the stream should go. If only recording, this can be an empty list.
3. **record**: *Boolean*. If recording is required, set true. If recording is not required, set false. This value has no effect on streaming.

* If both rtmpUrls and record = true are provided, both streaming and recording will begin.
* If only rtmpUrls are provided, only streaming will begin.
* If only record true is provided, only recording will begin.

If either one is started, the other can't be started without first stopping whatever is running.
Eg: Only streaming is started. Recording can't be started unless streaming is stopped first.

If both are required, they have to be started together by providing both RTMP Injest Urls and recording = true.

    override fun onSuccess() {
        // started successfully
    }

hmsSdk.startRtmpOrRecording(hmsRecordingConfig, new HMSActionResultListener() {
    @Override
    public void onSuccess() {
        // started successfully
    }

    @Override
    public void onError(@NonNull HMSException e) {
        // an error occurred
    }
});
```

# Stopping streaming / recording

To stop streaming AND recording. It is not currently possible to stop just one, whatever is running will be stopped.

Here's how to stop both:

<Tab id='stopstreamingrecording-0'>

```kotlin
hmsSdk.stopRtmpAndRecording(object : HMSActionResultListener {

    override fun onSuccess() {
        // Stop succeeded.
    }

    override fun onError(error: HMSException) {
        // Error while stopping.
    }
    
})

```

</Tab>

<Tab id='stopstreamingrecording-1'>

```java
hmsSdk.stopRtmpAndRecording(new HMSActionResultListener() {
    @Override
    public void onSuccess() {
        // Stop succeeded.
    }

    @Override
    public void onError(@NonNull HMSException e) {
        // Error while stopping.
    }
});
```
