Three main sections here are:
[Adding Jitpack](#adding-jitpack) - Since you need to retrieve the 100ms Android SDK.
[Adding the 100ms SDK](#adding-the-100ms-sdk) - To add the SDK to your project's dependencies.
[Adding Permissions](#permissions) - Since a video calling app needs camera/record-audio permissions you'll need this for the apps to work.

### Adding Jitpack

The 100ms SDK is distributed via Jitpack.

Add the JitPack repository to your root `settings.gradle` at the end of the `respositories` closure:
You can open it in Android Studio by double tapping the Shift key and typing `settings.gradle`. It will be in your project root.

```json{7}:settings.gradle
dependencyResolutionManagement {
 repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
 repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        jcenter() // Warning: this repository is going to shut down soon
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
rootProject.name = "MyVideoCallApp"
include ':app'

```

### Adding the 100ms SDK
Add the 100ms sdk dependency to your app-level `build.gradle` [![](https://jitpack.io/v/100mslive/android-sdk.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#100mslive/android-sdk).

```json{3,4}:build.gradle
dependencies {
    // See the version in the jitpack badge above.
    implementation 'com.github.100mslive.android-sdk:lib:x.x.x'
}
```

### Permissions

Camera, Recording Audio and Internet permissions are required. Add them to your manifest.

```xml:AndroidManifest.xml
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

You will also need to request Camera and Record Audio permissions at runtime before you join a call or display a preview. Please follow [Android Documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/requesting#request-permission) for runtime permissions.
