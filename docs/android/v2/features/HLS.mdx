title: HLS Streaming / Recording
nav: 13.2
---

HLS Streaming allows for scaling to millions of viewers in near real time. You can give a link of your
webapp which will be converted to a HLS feed by our server and can be played across devices for consumption.

Behind the scenes, this will be achieved by having a bot join your room and stream what it sees and hears. Once the feed is ready, the server will give a url which can be played using any HLS Player.

> Note that the media server serving the content in this case is owned by 100ms. If you're looking for a way to stream
on YouTube, Twitch etc., please have a look at our RTMP streaming docs [here](./RTMP-recording).

## Starting 

HLS can be started in three ways depending on the level of customization you need.
1. [Default View](#default-view): The simplest view to just begin a stream with default UI and parameters.
2. Portrait View: The default view streams a landscape video. This can be changed to portrait instead.
3. Custom Views: To use your own UI for HLS, you would need a custom implementation of the browser that joins to stream it. Provide your own URLs for it to join.

#### Default View

<Tabs id="hls-default-view" items={['Kotlin', 'Java']} />

<Tab id='hls-default-view-0'>

```kotlin
hmsSdkHost.startHLSStreaming(hmsActionResultListener = object : HMSActionResultListener {
    override fun onSuccess() {
        // hls was started successfully
    }

    override fun onError(error: HMSException) {
        // hls failed to start with error $error
    }

})
```

</Tab>

<Tab id='hls-default-view-1'>

```java
hmsSdkHost.startHLSStreaming(null, new HMSActionResultListener() {
    @Override
    public void onSuccess() {
        // hls was started successfully
    }

    @Override
    public void onError(@NonNull HMSException error) {
        // hls failed to start with error $error
    }
});

```

</Tab>

#### Portrait View

<Tabs id="hls-orientation-view" items={['Kotlin', 'Java']} />

<Tab id='hls-orientation-view-0'>

```kotlin
// Note the use of metadata to set the orientation from the default of 'landscape'
//  to 'portrait'
val hlsConfig = HMSHLSConfig(listOf(HMSHLSMeetingURLVariant(metadata = "portrait")))

hmsSdkHost.startHLSStreaming(hlsConfig, object : HMSActionResultListener {
    override fun onSuccess() {
        // hls was started successfully
    }

    override fun onError(error: HMSException) {
        // hls failed to start with error $error
    }

})
```

</Tab>

<Tab id='hls-orientation-view-1'>

```java
// Note the use of metadata to set the orientation from the default of 'landscape'
//  to 'portrait'
List<HMSHLSMeetingURLVariant> variantList = Arrays.asList(new HMSHLSMeetingURLVariant(null, "portrait"));
HMSHLSConfig hlsConfig = new HMSHLSConfig(variantList, null);

hmsSdkHost.startHLSStreaming(hlsConfig, new HMSActionResultListener() {
    @Override
    public void onSuccess() {

    }

    @Override
    public void onError(@NonNull HMSException error) {

    }
});

```

</Tab>

#### Custom View
To use our own browser UI for HLS, you'll need to pass in a meeting URL. The 100ms bot will open this URL to join your room, so
it must allow access without any user level interaction. In the future it'll be possible to start HLS for multiple such URLs for the same room.

For this purpose the API supports taking in an array, although currently only the first element of the array will be used. To distinguish between multiple urls an additional field `metadata` can be optionally passed. The `meetingURL` and `metadata` are clubbed together to form what we'll call a `variant`.

You can call `hmsSDK.startHLSStreaming` with a `HMSHLSConfig` having an array of such variants. `HMSHlsRecordingConfig` is optional.

<Tabs id="hls" items={['Kotlin', 'Java']} />

<Tab id='hls-0'>

```kotlin
fun hlsStreaming(meetingUrl : String, hmssdk: HMSSDK) {
        val meetingUrlVariant1 = HMSHLSMeetingURLVariant(
            meetingUrl = meetingUrl,
            metadata = "tag for reference"
        )

        val hlsConfig = HMSHLSConfig(listOf(meetingUrlVariant1))

        hmssdk.startHLSStreaming(hlsConfig, object : HMSActionResultListener {
            override fun onSuccess() {

            }

            override fun onError(error: HMSException) {

            }
        })
    }

```

</Tab>

<Tab id='hls-1'>


```java
public void hlsStreaming(String meetingUrl, HMSSDK hmssdk) {
    HMSHLSMeetingURLVariant meetingURLVariant1 = new HMSHLSMeetingURLVariant(
            meetingUrl,
            "tag for reference"
    );
    ArrayList<HMSHLSMeetingURLVariant> variantList = new ArrayList<>();
    variantList.add(meetingURLVariant1);

    HMSHLSConfig hlsConfig = new HMSHLSConfig(variantList, null);

    hmssdk.startHLSStreaming(hlsConfig, new HMSActionResultListener() {
        @Override
        public void onSuccess() {
            
        }

        @Override
        public void onError(@NonNull HMSException error) {

        }
    });
}
````

### Optional HLS Recording
Optionally to record the HLS stream you may specify an `HMSHlsRecordingConfig` within the `HMSHLSConfig`.

Here's what the `HMSHlsRecordingConfig` looks like

```kotlin

data class HMSHlsRecordingConfig(
    val singleFilePerLayer : Boolean,
    val videoOnDemand : Boolean
)

```

1. `singleFilePerLayer` if the desired end result is a mp4 file per HLS layer, false by default.
2. `videoOnDemand` if the desired end result is a zip of m3u8 and all the chunks, false by default.

Here's what it looks like to call for recording configs.

<Tabs id="hls-recording-config" items={['Kotlin', 'Java']} />

<Tab id='hls-recording-config-0'>

```kotlin
// Optional recording config
val hlsRecordingConfig = HMSHlsRecordingConfig(false, false)

val hlsConfig = HMSHLSConfig(listOf(meetingUrlVariant), hlsRecordingConfig)
```

</Tab>

<Tab id='hls-recording-config-1'>

```java
// Optional recording config
HMSHlsRecordingConfig recordingConfig = new HMSHlsRecordingConfig(false, false);

HMSHLSConfig hlsConfig = new HMSHLSConfig(variantList, recordingConfig);

```

</Tab>

## Stopping HLS

You can call `hmsSDK.stopHLSStreaming` to stop HLS Streaming which will stop all the variants.

<Tabs id="hls-stop" items={['Kotlin', 'Java']} />

<Tab id='hls-stop-0'>

```kotlin
hmssdk.stopHLSStreaming(null, object : HMSActionResultListener {
            override fun onSuccess() {
                
            }

            override fun onError(error: HMSException) {
                
            }

        })
```

</Tab>

<Tab id='hls-stop-1'>

```java
hmssdk.stopHLSStreaming(null, new HMSActionResultListener() {
            @Override
            public void onSuccess() {
                
            }

            @Override
            public void onError(@NonNull HMSException error) {

            }
        });
```

> Want to see how this works in a live project? [Take a look](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-android/blob/bba78d425c4e59e1344dc18f50b6494f5160a89f/app/src/main/java/live/hms/app2/ui/meeting/MeetingViewModel.kt#L933) at our advanced sample app.

## Current Room Status

The current status for the room is always reflected in the `HMSRoom` object.

Here are the relevant properties inside the `HMSRoom` object which you can read to get the current hls streaming status of the room namely: `hlsStreamingState`.

The object contains a boolean `running` which lets you know if it's active on the room right now as well as list of active variants.


1. **hlsStreamingState** an instance of `HMSHLSStreamingState`, which looks like:

```kotlin
data class HMSHLSStreamingState(
        val running : Boolean,
        val variants : ArrayList<HMSHLSVariant>?,
)
```

This represents a livestream to one or more HLS urls in the container of `HMSHLSVariant`. Which looks like:
```kotlin
data class HMSHLSVariant(
        val hlsStreamUrl: String?,
        val meetingUrl: String?,
        val metadata: String?,
        val startedAt: Long?
)
```

The room status should be checked in following two places -

1. In the `onJoin(room: HMSRoom)` callback of `HMSUpdateListener`
    The properties mentioned above will be on the `HMSRoom` object.
2. In the `onRoomUpdate(type: HMSRoomUpdate, hmsRoom: HMSRoom)` callback of `HMSUpdateListener`.
    The `HMSRoomUpdate` type will be `HMSRoomUpdate.HLS_STREAMING_STATE_UPDATED`.

## Tips

* If you're using the dashboard webapp from 100ms, please make sure to use a role which doesn't have publish permissions for beam tile to not show up.
* If using your own webapp, do put in place retries for API calls like tokens etc. just in case any call fails. As human users we're used to reloading the page in these scenarios which is difficult to achieve in the automated case.
* Make sure to not disable the logs for the passed in meeting URL. This will allow for us to have more visibility into the room, refreshing the page if join doesn't happen within a time interval.
