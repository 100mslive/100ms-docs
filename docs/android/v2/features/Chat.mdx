What's a video without being able to send messages to each other too? 100ms supports chat for every video/audio room you create.

### Sending Chat Messages

With the HMSSDK instance call sendMessage to send a message.

<Tabs id="chat" items={['Kotlin', 'Java']} />

<Tab id='chat-0'>

```kotlin
hmsSDK.sendMessage("chat", "Hello there!")
```
</Tab>

<Tab id='chat-1'>

```java
hmssdk.sendMessage("chat","Hello there");
```
</Tab>

### Receiving Chat Messages

When you called `hmsSdk.join(config, hmsUpdateListener)` to join a room, the `HMSUpdateListener` implementation that was passed in had the callback `fun onMessageReceived(message: HMSMessage)`.

This where you'll receive new messages as `HMSMessage` during the call. It contains:

```kotlin
    data class HMSMessage(
    val sender: HMSPeer,
    val message: String,
    val type: String,
    val time: Date,
    )
```

Identifying Senders:

The sender of a message is always contained in the `sender` field of HMSMessage. This lets you get the name and peer id for any message sender.

Message Body:

The body of the message is in `message` as a String.

Time:

The time the message was sent is contained in `time` as a Java Date.

### Putting together a list of chat messages.
The UI is completely up to you to decide! You'll also need to hold onto all the received messages if you want to display history.
