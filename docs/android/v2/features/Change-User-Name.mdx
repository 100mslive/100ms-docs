title: Change User Name
nav: 15.0

Any peer can change their own name before or after joining a room. Before joining, the name would have to be specified in `HMSConfig` that is passed to the join method.

## Responding to name changes

Whenever a remote peer's name is changed a callback will be received in `onPeerUpdate(update : HMSPeerUpdate, peer : HMSPeer)` of `HMSUpdateListener` where the `update` will be of type `HMSPeerUpdate.NAME_CHANGED`.

When this callback is received the UI for that peer should be updated as well.

## Changing the name

The peer who wants to change their name should call the following method on an `HMSSdk` instance.

<Tabs id="change-name" items={['Kotlin', 'Java']} />

<Tab id='change-name-0'>

```kotlin
val newName = "Ashwini Shetty"
hmsSdk.changeName(newName, object : HMSActionResultListener {
    override fun onSuccess() {

    }

    override fun onError(error: HMSException) {

    }

})
```

</Tab>

<Tab id='change-name-1'>

```java
String newName = "Ashwini Shetty";
hmsSdk.changeMetadata(newName, new HMSActionResultListener() {
    @Override
    public void onSuccess() {

    }

    @Override
    public void onError(@NonNull HMSException e) {

    }
});
```
</Tab>
