You're chatting away on your video call and, uh-oh, a phone call comes in. No worries, the 100ms SDK abstracts away handling this situation for you.

When a telephonic voice call comes in and the user accepts the following happens.

-   All videos including your own are turned off.
-   You are muted.

When the call ends the SDK will restore all videos, taking care not to unmute you if you had muted yourself before the call came in. Neither will it unmute all the peers if you had muted them from the app.

No code required, this happens automatically for all calls.
