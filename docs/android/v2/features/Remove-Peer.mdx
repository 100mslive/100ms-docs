title: Remove Peer

Someone's overstayed their welcome and now you need to remove a peer from the chat. Just call `hmsSdk.removePeerRequest`.

### Permissions

Can't let just anyone remove others from the call. First you need to create a [role](../foundation/templates-and-roles) with the permissions to remove others.

In the SDK, the permission to mute others is within  `PermissionsParams` `removeOthers` and you should check for that within the `HMSRole` of the peer to see if they have it.

Here's how to check whether the local peer has the permission to end the room:

<Tabs id="removepeerperm" items={['Kotlin', 'Java 8', 'Java 7']} />

<Tab id='removepeerperm-0'>

```kotlin
fun isAllowedToRemovePeer(): Boolean {
    return hmsSDK.getLocalPeer()!!
                .hmsRole.permission?
                .removeOthers == true
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab id='removepeerperm-1'>

```java
private boolean isAllowedToRemovePeer() {
    return Optional.ofNullable(hmsSdk.getLocalPeer())
            .map(HMSPeer::getHmsRole)
            .map(HMSRole::getPermission)
            .map(PermissionsParams::getRemoveOthers)
            .orElse(false);
}
```
</Tab>


<Tab id='endroom-2'>

```java
private boolean isAllowedToRemovePeer() {
    HMSLocalPeer peer = hmsSdk.getLocalPeer();
    if(peer != null) {
        HMSRole role = peer.getHmsRole();
        if(role != null) {
            PermissionsParams permissions = role.getPermission();
            if(permissions != null) {
                return permissions.getRemoveOthers();
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```
</Tab>

`hmsSdk.getLocalPeer()` will only return null if you're neither in a preview nor in a meeting. Since you likely won't need to check for permissions there assuming you won't get null is reasonable.

### Removing a peer

Once the permissions are checked to ensure the caller has the permission to remove a peer, remove them by calling `hmsSdk.removePeerRequest`.

The parameters are:

peer: is the `HMSRemotePeer` that you'd like to be removed from the call.

reason: is the string that should be conveyed to them as the reason for being removed.

hmsActionResultListener: is the listener that will convey the success or error of the server accepting the request.


<Tabs id="removepeer" items={['Kotlin', 'Java']} />

<Tab id='removepeer-0'>

```kotlin
fun requestPeerLeave(peer: HMSRemotePeer, reason: String) {
    hmsSDK.removePeerRequest(peer, reason,
         object : HMSActionResultListener{
            override fun onError(error: HMSException) {
            }

            override fun onSuccess() {
            }
    })
  }

```

</Tab>

<Tab id='removepeer-1'>

```java
public void requestPeerLeave(HMSRemotePeer peer, String reason) {
    hmsSdk.removePeerRequest(peer, reason, new HMSActionResultListener() {
        @Override
        public void onSuccess() {
            
        }

        @Override
        public void onError(@NonNull HMSException e) {

        }
    });
}
```
</Tab>

### Handling the remove peer callback

On the target of the `removePeerRequest` they will receive a call in `HMSUpdateListener` of `onRemovedFromRoom(notification : HMSRemovedFromRoom)`.

The `HMSRemovedFromRoom` object which is passed into the callback has the structure:

```kotlin
data class HMSRemovedFromRoom(
    val reason : String,
    val peerWhoRemoved : HMSRemotePeer?,
    val roomWasEnded : Boolean
)
```

reason: Is the string that the caller of `removePeerRequest` sent as the reason they were being removed from the room.

peerWhoRemoved: Is an `HMSRemotePeer` instance containing the details of the person who called `removePeerRequest`. This can be used to show the name of the person who removed them.

roomWasEnded: This will be false if the peer was removed. If true, it indicates that the peer was not removed, but the entire room was ended. See [End Room](End-Room) for details.

When this callback is received, the UI should be cleaned up from the client side. The video call would be ended from the SDK once this callback is sent.
