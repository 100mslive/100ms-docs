title: Join Room

Joining a room is one of the most basic functionalities so we at 100ms have built an easy, developer friendly API to get you started.


A user can interact with participants of a room only after _joining_ the room.

When user indicates that they want to _join_ the room, your app should have -
1. User Name, the name which should be displayed to other peers in the room
2. User ID, a unique identifier for the user. Usually a [UUID string](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/UUID.html#randomUUID--).
3. Room ID, the unique room identifier which would have been generated & passed to your app from the backend.
4. Authentication Token, the client side authentication token generated by your Token Service.
 
Now that you have aforementioned data, you can proceed to join a room.

1. First, create an instance of `HMSSDK` class. Store this instance as a property. Ensure that the SDK object is alive in memory so that you can receive event callbacks from SDK. Simplest way to do this is as follows -

<Tabs id="create-hmssdk" items={['Kotlin', 'Java']} />

<Tab id='create-hmssdk-0'>

```kotlin
  private val hmsSDK = HMSSDK
    .Builder(application)
    .build()
```
</Tab>

<Tab id='create-hmssdk-1'>

```java
    HMSSDK hmssdk = new HMSSDK.Builder(application)
                                .build();

```
</Tab>

Note: If you are using Preview then you must already have an instance of HMSSDK before invoking Preview APIs.

2. Next, create an object of `HMSConfig` class using the available joining configurations
<Tabs id="createconfig" items={['Kotlin', 'Java']} />

<Tab id='createconfig-0'>
```kotlin
val hmsConfig = HMSConfig("user display name", authToken)
```

<Tab id='createconfig-1'>
```java
HMSConfig config = new HMSConfig("user display name", authToken);
```
3. You'll want to handle the callbacks from joining the room by making your ViewModel, Presenter or whatever you're using to handle business logic implement the HMSUpdateListener interface and overriding the methods.

4. Now, we are primed to join the room. All you have to do is pass the `config` object to `hmsSDK`
<Tabs id="join-room" items={['Kotlin', 'Java']} />

<Tab id='join-room-0'>
```kotlin
fun joinRoom(config : HMSConfig, hmsUpdateListener : HMSUpdateListener)
    hmsSDK.join(config, hmsUpdateListener)
}
```
<Tab id='join-room-1'>
```java
private void joinRoom(HMSConfig config, HMSUpdateListener hmsUpdateListener ) {
    hmsSdk.join(config, hmsUpdateListener);
}

```
That's it. You have joined a room successfully. ü•≥

Now, let's take a look at the signature of the Join API
```kotlin
fun join(config: HMSConfig, hmsUpdateListener: HMSUpdateListener)
```

As evident, `join` accepts 2 arguments - 
- `config`: an object of type `HMSConfig` class, the room configuration object which encapsulates user & token data.
- `hmsUpdateListener`: a class conforming to `HMSUpdateListener` interface. 

The methods of `HMSUpdateListener` are invoked to notify updates happening in the room like a peer joins/leaves, a track got muted/unmutes, etc.

After calling `join` your app will be provided an update from the 100ms SDK.

‚úÖ If successful, the `fun onJoin(room: HMSRoom)` method of `HMSUpdateListener` will be invoked with information about the room encapsulated in the `HMSRoom` object. 

‚ùå If failure, the `fun onError(error: HMSException)` method will be invoked with exact failure reason.
