To join an audio or video call, the user needs to join a `room`. All participants in a room can see/hear each other if they have turned their respective audio and video on. They can also chat.

Server has send you the following to join a room:
1. [A room id.](#a-room-id)
2. [An auth token.](#an-auth-token)

## A room id

It can be created two ways.

#### Your Custom Server
Via your own server making calls to 100ms: [server-side API](/server-side/v2/basic-features/Room).

Once [registered](https://dashboard.100ms.live/register) you can find and create rooms at https://dashboard.100ms.live/rooms.
    
## An auth token

It can be created two ways.

#### Your Custom Server
Generate these via [server-side API](/server-side/v2/basic-features/Authentication).

#### Via 100ms Dashboard

2. Append api/token to the end of the token endpoint.

Make a POST request to it with the following body:

```json

{   "user_id": "customer-id-or-name",
    "role": "role-you-want-to-assign-eg-host",
    "room_id": "the-room-id-from-step1-eg-610a1d0c4c4edd8024e535c0"
