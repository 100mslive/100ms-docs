# Introduction

100ms provides the ability to record rooms.

All recordings are done server-side. This is done by piping all individual streams to 100ms' servers and then "composing" them into a single video in a pre-defined layout. This might be different from the layout used to display the video on your app.

## Enable recording

To enable recording for a room, set enabled to true in the recording_info object passed while [creating the room](/v1/server-side/Create-room)

## Choose a storage method

### Store with 100ms

-   To store recorded files with 100ms, don't send `upload_info` in the `recording_info` object passed while creating the room
-   Recorded videos' storage cost will be charged separately. Please contact support@100ms.liv

### Store in your S3 Bucket

**Provide access via IAM role**

-   Contact support@100ms.live to get an IAM role which will be used to access your s3
-   Don't send upload_info in recording_info object passed while creating the room

**Provide access by sharing AWS key/secret**

-   Create an IAM user and generate the credentials `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. Following is the sample policy that should be attached with the User

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:GetObjectAcl",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:PutObjectAcl"
            ],
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::<BUCKET_NAME>", "arn:aws:s3:::<BUCKET_NAME>/*"]
        }
    ]
}
```

-   Add your AWS `key` and `secret` in the `credentials` object passed to `upload_info` while creating the room.

## Retrieve recording

Recorded videos will be available from upto 5 minutes to 2 hours after a "session" ends. Each session will have a separate video file. A session starts when the first person joins an empty room and ends when the room has no participants left. A single room can have multiple sessions.

Recorded videos are available as mp4 files. These files will be available for download for 24 hours from creation and sent as part of the `recording.success` [event sent to your events webhook.](/v1/advanced/Events#recordingsuccess)
