description: Setup & deploy your token generation service

You will need to send a token - generated by a combination of `access_key`, `customer_secret`, `customer_id`, `app_id`, `peer_id` and `room_id` when initiating 100ms client

## Keys & Secrets

You can get following keys from the Developer section of 100ms Dashboard.

-   `app_access_key` - You can generate unique access_keys for multiple access points.
-   `app_secret` - This unique secret is used to sign the token. This should ideally be stored server-side.
-   `customer_id` - This is an identifier for your organisation.
-   `app_id` - You can use this to differentiate multiple apps which use 100ms.
-   `management_key` - This key is meant solely to identify your account with 100ms, it isn't secret. It can safely be published in places like JavaScript code, or in an Android or iPhone app.
-   `management_secret` - Secret API key should be kept confidential and only stored on your own servers.

## Host a token generation endpoint

Clone this [document on runkit](https://runkit.com/100mslive/100-ms-services)
Add the following environment variables in runkit settings/environment -

-   HMS_ACCESS_KEY = app_key
-   HMS_SECRET = app_secret
-   HMS_CUSTOMER_ID = customer_id
-   HMS_APP_ID = app_id
-   HMS_MANAGEMENT_KEY = management_key
-   HMS_MANAGEMENT_SECRET = management_secret

-   Publish your runkit and copy the [endpoint URL](https://runkit.com/docs/endpoint) (click on it and copy the URL that opens)

> Opening your published runkit endpoint in the browser gives error with statusCode = 400. Kindly ignore this error and move on to the next steps of implementation.
