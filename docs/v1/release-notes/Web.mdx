### Added

-   Support for mic change during meeting
-   Allow retry for publish and subscribe errors
-   dd subscribe failure events to analytics
-   Send reason (ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED | CONNECTION_CLOSED) when emitting disconnect event to distinguish between connection closing and not being able to establish a connection (because of wrong room id or internet issues)

---

## v1.0.0 - 2021-03-18

### Fixed

-   Screenshare on electron
-   This fix requires setting `shouldPublishVideo` to true when calling `getLocalStream` to get the desktop capturer stream in electron

---

## v0.9.26 - 2021-03-13

### Fixed

-   Accepting string as custom metadata instead of an object.

---

## v0.9.25 - 2021-03-11

### Added

-   An option to add custom metadata as part of peer creation.
-   This breaks the incoming stream from electron screen share and other devices which send custom metadata as a string. We highly recommend upgrading to v0.9.26.
-   Audio level monitoring - Two new methods startAudioLevelMonitor and stopAudioLevelMonitor have been added to monitor the audio levels of all the streams.

### Changed

-   Reverted camera mute/unmute logic. This re-introduces the green light staying issue when the camera is switched off in Chrome/Safari/Edge/Opera

---

## v0.9.24 - 2021-03-08

### Added

-   Event analytics

### Fixed

-   Publish returns localStream with mid immediately and we no longer need to poll for mid
-   Honour `shouldPublishAudio` and shouldPublishVideo in `getLocalStream` correctly
-   Do not show green light when unmuting the video
