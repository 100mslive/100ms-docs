Overview
100ms is a cloud platform that allows developers to add video and audio conferencing to Web, Android and iOS applications. The platform provides REST APIs, SDKs, and helper tools that make it simple to capture, distribute, record, and render high-quality audio, video, and screen shares.
Any application built using 100ms' SDKs has 2 components
Client: Client-side code that runs in a browser or mobile app, set up by the developer using the 100ms' client-side SDKs, which are available for Web, iOS and Android. Client-side handles the majority of 100ms' functionality.
Server: Server-side code that provides services for token generation, room creation and webhooks for events and recordings.
How 100ms Video Conferencing Applications Work
Server creates a room
Your server calls 100ms' Rooms API to create a room using a management token. After validating the token, 100ms returns a room_id, a unique identifier for a room which can be used later by clients
Client gets an access token
You client requests a token from your server. This is typically achieved by an HTTP request from your client application to your server
Client connects to a room
Client then connects to the previously generated room_id by calling 100ms' SDK's connect method
Client publishes its audio/video stream and/or subscribes to remote streams
After successful connection, client calls 100ms' SDK's getUserMedia method to capture camera/mic stream and then publishes it to the room by using SDK's publish method
Client receives all streams published by remote peers to the room by using 100ms' SDK's listeners and subscribe method
Basic Concepts
Room - A room represents a real-time audio, video session, the basic building block of the 100ms Video SDK
Stream - A stream represents real-time audio, video streams that are shared to a room. Usually, each stream contains a video track and an audio track (except screenshare streams, which contains only a video trac)
Track - A track represents either the audio or video that makes up a stream
Peer - A peer represents all participants connected to a room. Peers can be "local" or "remote"
Publish - A local peer can share its audio, video by "publishing" its tracks to the room
Subscribe - A local peer can stream any peer's audio, video by "subscribing" to their streams
Broadcast - A local peer can send any message/data to all remote peers in the room.
