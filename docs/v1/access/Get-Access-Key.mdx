# Get access Keys

You can get following access keys in the [Developer](https://dashboard.100ms.live/login) section of [100ms dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/login)

-   `access_key` - You can generate unique access_keys for multiple access points
-   `app_secret` - This unique secret is used to sign the token
-   `customer_id` - This is an identifier for your organisation
-   `app_id` - You can use this to differentiate multiple apps which use 100ms
-   `management_key` - This key is meant solely to identify your account with 100ms, it isn't secret. It can safely be published in places like JavaScript code, or in an Android or iPhone app.
-   `management_secret` - Secret API key should be kept confidential and only stored on your own servers.

If you already have access keys, please move to the next section for details about the development.
