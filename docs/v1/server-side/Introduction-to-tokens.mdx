# Introduction to tokens

100ms Access Tokens are based on the [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/) standard. You can read about the details of the JWT format for Access Tokens in this section, but if you're using [one of our runkit endpoints](https://runkit.com/apnerve/100ms-services) you can clone them without having to know how they're constructed.

## JWT Format

Each Access Token is a [JWT](https://jwt.io/), which is an encoded JSON object with three parts: the header, the payload, and the signature. The following is a sample 100ms server-side JWT token

```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhY2Nlc3Nfa2V5IjoiNWZkMGNjNzY3Yjg2MDUyZjE0Mzg0NDdmIiwiaWF0IjoxNjA5NDgxNDYxLCJleHAiOjE2MDk1Njc4NjEsImlzcyI6IjVmY2NiN2RjNzI5MDkyNzJiZjk5OTVlNCIsImp0aSI6ImE3OWYxNjZkLWI4MmEtNDA0Yi1hNTI5LWExMzFmNTdjMTRjZCJ9.Qi1BYyV5UaE9ep57eJsUGcwqa86nEaNr-o-4ChgbSIU
```

If we inspect it with the [debugger at jwt.io](https://jwt.io/), we can further explore its content.

### Header

```JSON
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

The `header` section encodes the format of the token:

-   `alg` is the algorithm used to encode the token. It MUST be “HS256”
-   `typ` is the type of token. It MUST be "JWT"

### Payload

```json
{
    "access_key": "5fd0cc767b86052f1438447f",
    "iat": 1609481461,
    "exp": 1609567861,
    "iss": "5fccb7dc72909272bf9995e4",
    "jti": "a79f166d-b82a-404b-a529-a131f57c14cd"
}
```

The payload section describes the authorisation granted:

-   `jti` is a unique identifier for the token
-   `iss` is the issuer - for all 100ms tokens, your customer_id is used as issuer
-   `iat` is the timestamp on which the token was generated.
-   `exp` is the timestamp on which the token will expire. We advise generating tokens for a maximum of 24 hours
-   `access_key` is the 100ms key .used to generate the token. This can be your app_access_key (for client-side tokens) or management_key (for server-side tokens)

### Signature

The `signature` section is a signed hash that serves to prove the authenticity of the token. It is the result of hashing the JWT header and payload together with your API secret, which should only be known to your application and 100ms.
