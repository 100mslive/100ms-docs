title: HMSStoreWrapper
---

HMS store can be used to:

- Get a part of the current store or state(getState)
- Subscribe to different parts of the store using selectors and execute a callback when the value changes.
  Both getState and subscribe use selectors to query a part the store.
  Selectors are functions with HMSStore as an argument and returns a part of the store.
  **StoreSelector** is a type alias for this type of function.
