title: HMSVideoPlugin
nav: '4.77'
---

A plugin implementing this interface can be registered with HMSLocalVideoTrack to transform, process or
analyze the local video track.These can include applications like video filters, virtual background, live
analysis of video etc. The below functions are required for the sdk to properly use the plugin, usually
the plugin would also be exposing some public functions of its own for the UI to control its working.

## Methods

### checkSupport

▸ **checkSupport**(): [`HMSPluginSupportResult`](/api-reference/javascript/v2/interfaces/HMSPluginSupportResult)

This function will be called before the call to init, it is used to check whether the plugin supports current
OS and device or not. An error will be thrown back to the user if they try to use an unsupported plugin.

#### Returns

[`HMSPluginSupportResult`](/api-reference/javascript/v2/interfaces/HMSPluginSupportResult)

---

### getContextType

▸ `Optional` **getContextType**(): [`HMSVideoPluginCanvasContextType`](/api-reference/javascript/v2/enums/HMSVideoPluginCanvasContextType)

#### Returns

[`HMSVideoPluginCanvasContextType`](/api-reference/javascript/v2/enums/HMSVideoPluginCanvasContextType)

---

### getName

▸ **getName**(): `string`

The name is meant to uniquely specify a plugin instance. This will be used to track number of plugins
added to the track, and same name won't be allowed twice.

#### Returns

`string`

---

### getPluginType

▸ **getPluginType**(): [`HMSVideoPluginType`](/api-reference/javascript/v2/enums/HMSVideoPluginType)

#### Returns

[`HMSVideoPluginType`](/api-reference/javascript/v2/enums/HMSVideoPluginType)

**`See`**

### init

▸ **init**(): `Promise`<`void`\>

This function will be called in the beginning for initialization which may include tasks like setting up
variables, loading ML models etc. This can be used by a plugin to ensure it's prepared at the time
processVideoFrame is called.

#### Returns

`Promise`<`void`\>

---

### isSupported

▸ **isSupported**(): `boolean`

@deprecated. Will be deleted in future updates. Use checkSupport instead.

#### Returns

`boolean`

---

### processVideoFrame

▸ **processVideoFrame**(`input`, `output?`, `skipProcessing?`): `void` \| `Promise`<`void`\>

This function will be called by the SDK for every video frame which the plugin needs to process.
PluginFrameRate - the rate at which the plugin is expected to process the video frames. This is not necessarily
equal to the capture frame rate. The user can specify this rate, and the sdk might also change it on basis of
device type, or CPU usage.
For an analyzing plugin, the below function will be called at plugin framerate.
For a transforming plugin, the sdk will pass in the input and output at real frame rate with an additional boolean
pass. The expectation is that the plugin should use results of previous runs instead of doing a complex processing
again when pass is set to true. This helps in maintaining the framerate of the video as well as bringing down
CPU usage in case of complex processing.

#### Parameters

| Name              | Type                | Description                                             |
| :---------------- | :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| `input`           | `HTMLCanvasElement` | input canvas containing the input frame                 |
| `output?`         | `HTMLCanvasElement` | the output canvas which should contain the output frame |
| `skipProcessing?` | `boolean`           | use results from previous run if true                   |

#### Returns

`void` \| `Promise`<`void`\>

---

### stop

▸ **stop**(): `void`

the plugin can use this function to dispose off its resources. It'll be called when the processor instance is
no longer needed at the end.

#### Returns

`void`
