### subscribe

• **subscribe**: `Subscribe`<[`HMSStore`](/api-reference/javascript/v2/interfaces/HMSStore)\>

Subscribe to a part of store using selectors, whenever the subscribed part changes, the callback
is called with both the latest and previous value of the changed part. The subscribe also returns
a reference to `unsubscribe`, which could be used to unsubscribe the subscription.

Usage:

```
const onSpeakerUpdate = (speaker, prevSpeaker) => {
 console.log("speaker changed from - ", prevSpeaker, ", to - ", speaker);
}
const unsub = store.subscribe(onSpeakerUpdate, selectDominantSpeaker);

// To unsubscribe from the listener,
unsub();

```

#### Inherited from

IStore.subscribe
