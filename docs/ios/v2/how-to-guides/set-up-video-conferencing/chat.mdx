What's a video without being able to send messages to each other too? 100ms supports chat for every video/audio room you create.

You can see an example of every way of sending messages and interpreting messages in the advanced [sample app](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-ios-sdk).

### Addressing messages

-   [Broadcast messages](#sending-broadcast-messages) can be sent to Everyone in the chat `hmssdk.sendBroadcastMessage`.

-   [Direct messages](#sending-direct-messages) let you send message to a specific person `hmssdk.sendDirectMessage`.

-   [Group messages](#sending-group-messages) let you send a message to everyone with a particular `HMSRole`. Such as all `hosts` or all `teachers` or all `students` `hmsSdk.sendGroupMessage`

### Sending Chat Messages

#### Sending Broadcast Messages

You want to let everyone in the chat know something? Call `sendBroadcastMessage` on the instance of `HMSSDK` to a send a broadcast.

The text of the message, its type and a listener for whether the message reached the server or not are the parameters.

> ðŸ’¡ Note that the callback only lets you know if the server has received your request for the message or if there was some error. It does not convey whether the message was delivered to or read by the recipient.
> also it's important to make a new callback per message because it will only contain the results of that particular call for sending a message.

```swift
hmssdk.sendBroadcastMessage(type: "chat", message: "") { message, error in

}
```

#### Sending Direct Messages

Got secrets to share? Send a message directly to a single person in the chat with a direct message. Call `sendDirectMessage` on an instance of `HMSSDK`.

The text of the message, its type and a listener for whether the message reached the server or not are the parameters.

> ðŸ’¡ Note that the callback only lets you know if the server has received your request for the message or if there was some error. It does not convey whether the message was delivered to or read by the recipient.
> also it's important to make a new callback per message because it will only contain the results of that particular call for sending a message.

```swift
hmssdk.sendDirectMessage(type: "chat", message: "", peer: recipientPeer) { message, error in

}
```

#### Sending Group Messages

Want to share with a group? Send a message directly to a group in the chat with a group message. Call `sendGroupMessage` on an instance of `HMSSDK`.

The text of the message, its type and a listener for whether the message reached the server or not are the parameters.

> ðŸ’¡ Note that the callback only lets you know if the server has received your request for the message or if there was some error. It does not convey whether the message was delivered to or read by the recipient.
> also it's important to make a new callback per message because it will only contain the results of that particular call for sending a message.

```swift
hmssdk.sendGroupMessage(type: "chat", message: "", roles: recipientRoles) { message, error in

}
```

### Receiving Chat Messages

When you called `hmsSdk.join(config, delegate)` to join a room, the `HMSUpdateListener` implementation that was passed in had the callback `on(message:)`.

This where you'll receive new messages as `HMSMessage` during the call. It contains:

```swift
public class HMSMessage {
    public let message: String
    public let type: String
    public var sender: HMSPeer?
    public var recipient: HMSMessageRecipient
    public let time: Date
}
```

`message`: Content of the text message or the text description of the raw message.

`type`: Type of message sent. Default value is `chat`.

`recipient`: The intended recipient(s) of this message as a `HMSMessageRecipient`.

`time`: Timestamp of when the messaging server receives this message. Update the time in your own messages when this comes back from the server in `on(message:)` for accurate ordering of your own messages.

`sender`: The `HMSPeer` who is sending this message.

Identifying Senders: The sender of a message is always contained in the `sender` field of HMSMessage. This lets you get the name and peer id for any message sender.

Message Body: The body of the message is in `message` as a String.

Time: The time the message was sent is contained in `time`.

#### Identifying who the message was for

The HMSMessageRecipient contained in the `recipient` field of `HMSMessage` lets you know who the message was for.

The `HMSMessageRecipient` contains:

```swift
public class HMSMessageRecipient {
    public let type: HMSMessageRecipientType
    public let peerRecipient: HMSPeer?
    public let rolesRecipient: [HMSRole]?
}
```

`peerRecipient`: Only contains a peer when a specific single peer is being direct messaged.

`rolesRecipient`: Only contains values when a group message is being sent to one or many roles.

`type`: Will be `broadcast` for a message being sent to everyone. If this is true, the other two field will be null, empty respectively.

`peer`: will be set when it's a direct message.

`roles`: will be set when it's a message to one or many roles.

## How to send message to another participant

You use `send(message: , to:)` method on `HMSRoomModel` instance to send a message to another participant.
```swift
try await roomModel.send(message: /* text message as string */, to recipient: /* instance of HMSRecipient */, type: /* optional type of message; type is "chat" by default*/)
```
    <details open>
    <summary>Code in context</summary>
```swift
//Send a text message to everyone
try await roomModel.send("How is it going?", to: .everyone)
```
```swift
//Send a text message to a random remote participant
guard let randomRemoteParticiapnt = roomModel.remotePeerModels.randomElement() else {return}
try await roomModel.send(message: "How is it going?", to: .peer(randomRemoteParticiapnt))
```
```swift
//Send a text message to all participant with student role
guard let studentRole = (roomModel.roles.first{$0.name == "student"}) else { return }
try await roomModel.send(message: "How is it going?", to: .role(studentRole))
```
    </details>

## How to receive messages from other participants

You can access received messages from messages property of RoomModel like following:
```swift
roomModel.messages
```
 <details open>
    <summary>Code in context</summary>
```swift
// show list of all received messages.
List {
    ForEach(roomModel.messages, id: \.self) { hmsMessage in
        Text(hmsMessage.message)
    }
}
```
</details>
