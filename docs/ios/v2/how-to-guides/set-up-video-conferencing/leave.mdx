Leaving a room should be quick. Once a user wishes to end their interaction in the room, they can choose to leave the meeting. ðŸ‘‹

100ms SDK provides a simple, no fuss API to do exactly that.

Invoke the `leave` method on instance of `HMSSDK`.

```swift
hmsSDK.leave()
```

<Tab id='sample-code-1'>
Invoke the `leaveSession` method on instance of `HMSRoomModel`.

```swift
try await roomModel.leaveSession()
```

    <summary>Code in context</summary>
```swift
import HMSRoomModels

struct MeetingView: View {
    
    @ObservedObject var roomModel = HMSRoomModel(roomCode: "qdr-mik-seb")
    
    var body: some View {
        
        switch roomModel.roomState {
            
        case .notJoined, .leftMeeting:
            // Button to join the room
            ...
        case .inMeeting:
            VStack {
                // Button to leave the room
                Button {
                    Task {
                        try await roomModel.leaveSession()
                    }
                } label: {
                    Text("Leave")
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
</details>
</Tab>

You should expect that the `leave` function always succeeds, even in scenarios like "No Internet Connection", "Low Battery", etc
