# Share Just Your App's Screen

You can use the hmsSDK instance to start sharing your app screen like below:

```swift
    hmsSDK.startAppScreenCapture() { error in
        // handle any errors
    }
```

You can stop stop sharing your screen like below:

```swift
    hmsSDK.stopAppScreenCapture() { error in
        // handle any errors
    }
```

## How to check if user is sharing their screen

There are 2 approaches that we suggest for checking if user is sharing screen:

1. Check if the screen is added as a local track for the user like shown below

```swift
if localPeer?.auxiliaryTracks?.first(where: { $0.source == HMSCommonTrackSource.screen }) != nil {
    // Screen is getting shared
}
```

2. Maintain a state variable when screen track is added or removed like shown below

```swift
    var isSharingScreen = false
    func on(track: HMSTrack, update: HMSTrackUpdate, for peer: HMSPeer) {

        if update == .trackAdded {

            if peer.isLocal && track.source == HMSCommonTrackSource.screen {
                isSharingScreen = true
            }
        }

        if update == .trackRemoved {

            if peer.isLocal && track.source == HMSCommonTrackSource.screen {
                isSharingScreen = false
            }
        }
    }
```

# Share The Entire Device Screen

To share entire device screen the SDK uses [Replaykit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/replaykit) framework from Apple. To understand the documentation better consider familiarising yourself with live screen broadcast in iOS: https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/601

Please note that for a peer to share their screen, their role must have screenshare enabled in the dashboard. Also, select the appropriate resolution that you desire the screenshare track should be of.

![ScreenshareDashboard](/docs/v2/screenshare-dashboard.png)

## How to start screenshare from the app

You create an iOS broadcast upload extension. It uses Apple's ReplayKit framework to record the device screen and delivers frame samples to your broadcast extension. You can share not only your own app but also the entire device screen including other apps on the device.

HMSBroadcastExtensionSDK is made specifically to be used in the iOS broadcast upload extension target. After importing the SDK, you use HMSScreenRenderer class to process the sample buffer coming from RPBroadcastSampleHandler. These samples are then presented in your main meeting app as a screen recording track.

Example project shown in the walkthrough is available [here](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-ios-sdk/tree/main/ScreenSharingExample).

## How to import

### Using Swift Package Manager

You can use [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/package-manager) (use https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-ios-broadcast-sdk.git as the package source)

Add HMSBroadcastExtensionSDK to your main app target from Swift Package Manager. Then add HMSBroadcastExtensionSDK to your iOS broadcast upload extension target.

### Using CocoaPods

Get the HMSBroadcastExtensionSDK via [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/). Add the `pod 'HMSBroadcastExtensionSDK'` to your broadcast upload extension target in Podfile as follows:

```ruby
# Podfile

platform :ios, '12.0'

target 'MainApp' do
  pod 'HMSSDK'
end

target 'HMSScreenShare' do
  pod 'HMSBroadcastExtensionSDK'
end
```

## How to use HMSBroadcastExtensionSDK to share iOS screen with other participants in the room?

iOS broadcast extension provides you with CMSampleBuffers that you can process using HMSBroadcastExtensionSDK. This enabled you to share the screen with other participants in the room in your main app that uses HMSSDK.

## How to create Replaykit Broadcast extension?

1. Create a Broadcast Upload Extension target that is embedded in your app project target.
2. You create a subclass of RPBroadcastSampleHandler and override the processSampleBuffer function. This gives you access to the CMSampleBuffer provided by the Replaykit framework.

## How to configure your main app and extension to enable screen sharing

1. Configure an [App Group](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/configuring-app-groups) for your main app. Choose the same App Group for your broadcast extension target.
2. In your main app set the app group string to the hmssdk instance like below:

```swift
    hmsSDK = HMSSDK.build { sdk in
            sdk.appGroup = "group.live.100ms.videoapp"
            ...
        }
```

3. In your broadcast extension import HMSBroadcastExtensionSDK

```swift
    import HMSBroadcastExtensionSDK
```

4. Create an instance of HMSScreenRenderer passing the app group string like below:

```swift
  class SampleHandler: RPBroadcastSampleHandler {

  let screenRenderer = HMSScreenRenderer(appGroup: "group.live.100ms.videoapp")

  ...
```

HMSScreenRenderer uses this app group string to talk to your main app.

## How to share the screen in meeting

In your Broadcast Extension, you create a subclass of RPBroadcastSampleHandler class. This class handles screen frame samples produced by Replaykit. Replaykit delivers these frames as CMSampleBuffer to processSampleBuffer function.

In your processSampleBuffer function call process function on your screenRenderer instance passing the CMSampleBuffer like below:

```swift
  override func processSampleBuffer(_ sampleBuffer: CMSampleBuffer, with sampleBufferType: RPSampleBufferType) {
      switch sampleBufferType {
      case RPSampleBufferType.video:
          // Handle video sample buffer
          screenRenderer.process(sampleBuffer)
      ...
  }
```

## How to invalidate the connection between main app and extension when the user stops screen recording

When the user stops screen sharing broadcastFinished function is called on your RPBroadcastSampleHandler class. At that point, call invalidate on your screenRenderer instance to stop screen sharing.

```swift
    override func broadcastFinished() {
        // User has requested to finish the broadcast.
        self.screenRenderer.invalidate()
    }
```

## Stop screen sharing when the user leaves the room

When a user leaves the meeting room from the main app, you will receive an error HMSScreenRendererErrorCode.noActiveMeeting when calling process on screenRenderer instance. You can handle this error to stop the broadcast extension like below:

```swift
    override func processSampleBuffer(_ sampleBuffer: CMSampleBuffer, with sampleBufferType: RPSampleBufferType) {
        switch sampleBufferType {
        case RPSampleBufferType.video:
            // Handle video sample buffer
            if let error = screenRenderer.process(sampleBuffer) {
                if error.code == .noActiveMeeting {
                    finishBroadcastWithError(NSError(domain: "ScreenShare", code: error.code.rawValue, userInfo: [NSLocalizedFailureReasonErrorKey : "You are not in a meeting."]))
                }
            }
        ...
    }
```

## How to check if user is sharing their screen

There are 3 approaches that we suggest for checking if user is sharing screen:

1. Check if the screen is added as a local track for the user like shown below

```swift
if localPeer?.auxiliaryTracks?.first(where: { $0.source == HMSCommonTrackSource.screen }) != nil {
    // Screen is getting shared
}
```

2. Maintain a state variable when screen track is added or removed like shown below

```swift
    var isSharingScreen = false
    func on(track: HMSTrack, update: HMSTrackUpdate, for peer: HMSPeer) {

        if update == .trackAdded {

            if peer.isLocal && track.source == HMSCommonTrackSource.screen {
                isSharingScreen = true
            }
        }

        if update == .trackRemoved {

            if peer.isLocal && track.source == HMSCommonTrackSource.screen {
                isSharingScreen = false
            }
        }
    }
```

3. Use the app group user-defaults to store the state of screen sharing from broadcast extension (using broadcastStarted and broadcastFinished functions)

## Debugging issues in your screen-share implementation

1. If you use CocoaPods with M1 mac and compile for simulator then you might run into an error like this: "error framework not found Pods_hmsscreenshare". This issue is specific to CocoaPods method of integrating the 100ms SDK. If you use swift package manager, you wouldn't run into this error. As a workaround please use a snippet similar to at the end of this example Podfile to exclude arm64 arch for simulator from your pod screen share target:
   Workaround for M1 simulator issue https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-ios-sdk/blob/main/Example/Podfile
   Note: Pods-HMSScreenShare in the snippet is your CocoaPods framework target for broadcast extension (it's generally Pods-[Your Broadcast Extension target name])

2. If you are getting a crash while running with screen share feature, please make sure that the app group identifier is not misspelled in both the main app and the broadcast extension. Also make sure your entitlement file has the correct app group name.

## Frequently asked questions

1. How can I show only my screen share extension to the user when they want to share the screen using RPSystemBroadcastPickerView?

You can configure your RPSystemBroadcastPickerView instance to display only your extension by assigning a preferredExtension value to it:

```swift
    let systemBroadcastPicker = RPSystemBroadcastPickerView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y:0, width: 44, height: 44))
    systemBroadcastPicker.preferredExtension = "live.100ms.videoapp.screenshare"
```

Replace "live.100ms.videoapp.screenshare" with the bundle ID of your own broadcast extension. This ensures that only your screen share extension is displayed to the user when selecting the option to share their screen.

# How to share iOS screen of local user

You need to follow following steps to be able to share screen from iOS app:

1. Make a new **Broadcast Upload Extension** target from Xcode. This target will be embedded into your application. Xcode automatically sets everything up if you use Xcode template named **Broadcast Upload Extension** to create the target.
2. Add **App Group** capability in your **main app** target as well as in this new **Broadcast Upload Extension** target. Use the same App Group ID in both the targets. Let's assume your app group id is "group.live.100ms.videoapp.roomkit".
3. Xcode creates a **SampleHandler.swift** file in a new folder for your **Broadcast Upload Extension** target. Modify this **SampleHandler.swift** file to contain the following code (delete all the code in **SampleHandler.swift** file and paste the following code):

```swift
import HMSBroadcastExtensionSDK

class SampleHandler: HMSBroadcastSampleHandler {
    
    override var appGroupId: String {
        "group.live.100ms.videoapp.roomkit"
    }
}
```

Where "group.live.100ms.videoapp.roomkit" is the app group ID of your app group that created in step 2. Make sure to replace it with your App Group ID string.

5. With the above steps completed, let your RoomModel instance know about your App Group ID like below:

```swift
@ObservedObject var roomModel = HMSRoomModel(roomCode: "qdw-mil-sev", options: .init(appGroupName: "group.live.100ms.videoapp.roomkit"))
```

6. At this point you are ready to share screen of local iOS user. You can use the following code to make a button to start screen sharing from inside your app UI:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import HMSRoomModels
import ReplayKit

struct RoomModelStandaloneExample: View {
    
    @ObservedObject var roomModel = HMSRoomModel(roomCode: "qdw-mil-sev", options: .init(appGroupName: "group.live.100ms.videoapp.roomkit"))
    
    @StateObject var broadcastPickerView = {
        let picker = RPSystemBroadcastPickerView(frame: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 100, height: 100))
        picker.showsMicrophoneButton = false
        return picker
    }()
    
    var body: some View {
        
        switch roomModel.roomState {
        case .notJoined, .leftMeeting:
            // Button to join the room
            ...
        case .inMeeting:
            VStack {
                List {
                    
                    // If a participant is sharing their screen, show their screen at the top of the list
                    ...
                        
                    // Render video of each peer in the call
                    ...
                }
                
                HStack {
                    
                    // Toggle local user's mic
                    ...
                    
                    // Toggle local user's camera
                    ...

                    // Share local user's screen from iOS
                    if roomModel.userCanShareScreen {
                        Image(systemName: "rectangle.inset.filled.and.person.filled")
                            .onTapGesture {
                                for subview in broadcastPickerView.subviews {
                                    if let button = subview as? UIButton {
                                        button.sendActions(for: UIControl.Event.allTouchEvents)
                                    }
                                }
                            }
                            .onAppear() {
                                broadcastPickerView.preferredExtension = "live.100ms.videoapp.roomkit.Screenshare"
                            }
                    }
                    
                    // Button to leave the room
                    ...
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Where "live.100ms.videoapp.roomkit.Screenshare" is the bundle id of your **Broadcast Upload Extension** target.

# How to check if a participant is sharing their screen

You can check if a peer is sharing their screen by checking `HMSPeerModel`'s `isSharingScreen` property. Also, you can find out which participants are sharing their screens using **peersSharingScreen** property of RoomModel instance.
```swift
peerModel.isSharingScreen
roomModel.peersSharingScreen
```

# How to show/render a Participant's Screen Track

You use **HMSScreenTrackView** and pass a peer model to show/render its screen track. You can check which participants are sharing their screens using **peersSharingScreen** property of RoomModel instance.

Example: If a participant is sharing their screen, show their screen at the top of the peer video list.

```swift
...

List {

    // If a participant is sharing their screen, show their screen at the top of the list
    if roomModel.peersSharingScreen.count > 0 {
        TabView {
            ForEach(roomModel.peersSharingScreen) { screenSharingPeer in
                HMSScreenTrackView(peer: screenSharingPeer)
            }
        }
        .tabViewStyle(.page(indexDisplayMode: .never))
        .frame(height: 200)
    }

    // Render video of each peer in the call
    ForEach(roomModel.peerModels) { peerModel in
        VStack {
            Text(peerModel.name)
            HMSVideoTrackView(peer: peerModel)
                .frame(height: 200)
        }
    }
}

...
```
