 title: Adaptive Bitrate (Simulcast)
 nav: 4.42
---

Simulcast enables [Adaptive Bitrate](/get-started/v2/get-started/features/quality/adaptive-bitrate) (ABR) in video conferencing scenarios. This means 100ms SDKs can upgrade or downgrade video quality for remote tracks based on user preferences or network conditions.

## Minimum Requirements

-   SDK version 0.5.1 or higher
-   Simulcast enabled in room template

## 100ms SDK Simulcast APIs

You interact with the simulcast feature by setting `HMSRemoteVideoTrack`'s `layer` property. Let's look at the track interface:

```swift
class HMSRemoteVideoTrack {
    open var layerDefinitions: [HMSSimulcastLayerDefinition]?
    open var layer: HMSSimulcastLayer
}

class HMSSimulcastLayerDefinition : NSObject {
    open var layer: HMSSimulcastLayer
    open var resolution: CGSize
}

enum HMSSimulcastLayer {
    case high
    case mid
    case low
}
```

Here `layerDefinitions` property holds an array of currently available layers for the track and `layer` property is the currently selected layer. Within `HMSSimulcastLayerDefinition` you get its resolution and the layer name such as high/mid/low.

## Auto Layer Selection

`HMSVideoView` has an automatic simulcast layer selection capability which is enabled by default. It will select a layer that best matches the current view frame size and reacts to frame updates. In case manual layer selection is preferred set `disableAutoSimulcastLayerSelect` property to `true`. By default, the track layer is set to `high`.
