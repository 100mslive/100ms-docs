It's finally time to bring everything together and display live streaming video in our app. Don't worry, it's easier than you think.

Here's what you need to do:

<Tabs
  id="sample-code"
  items={["UIKit", "SwiftUI"]}

<Tab id='sample-code-0'>
1. Create an HMSVideoView object in your view hierarchy. This is a subclass of UIView, so add it to your UI just like any other view, using Storyboard, XIB or in-code.

2. Get a reference to a video track object, specifically an HMSVideoTrack or one of its subclasses (eg. HMSLocalVideoTrack). For example, the local peer's video track can be accessed like this:

```swift
let track = hmsSDK.localPeer?.videoTrack
```

3. Connect the video track to the video view using the setVideoTrack method of HMSVideoView:

```swift
let videoView = HMSVideoView()
videoView.frame = CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 100, height: 100)
...

videoView.setVideoTrack(track) // videoView is HMSVideoView, track is HMSVideoTrack
```

That's it. The video transmitted by the peer will now be displayed and start playing in your video view. ðŸ¥³

Remember, it's all about connecting the Video Track to the Video View. You'll be doing this often.

Create `HMSVideoTrackView` object and pass a peer model instance to show/render its video track.
```swift
HMSVideoTrackView(peer: /* pass an instance of HMSPeerModel*/)
```

    var body: some View {
        
        switch roomModel.roomState {
        case .notJoined, .leftMeeting:
            // Button to join the room

                            Text(peerModel.name)
                            HMSVideoTrackView(peer: peerModel)
                                .frame(height: 200)
