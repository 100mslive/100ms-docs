The 100ms SDK provides robust APIs for integrating whiteboard collaboration into your conferencing sessions. Participants can engage in real-time by drawing, writing, and collaborating on a shared digital whiteboard. This documentation outlines how to implement the start and stop functionality for a whiteboard and display it within a WebView.

## Minimum Requirements

- Minimum 100ms SDK version required is 1.9.0
- User roles must be configured to enable whiteboard functionality via the 100ms dashboard for starting or viewing the whiteboard.

## Displaying the Shared Whiteboard

To incorporate the shared whiteboard into your application, subscribe to whiteboard updates using the `WhiteboardUpdateListener` provided by the interactivity center of HMSSDK. Below is an example implementation in Swift:

```swift

let webview: WKWebView?
...

hmsSdk.interactivityCenter.addWhiteboardUpdateListener { [weak self] whiteboard, updateType in
  switch updateType {
      case .started:

          // Open the whiteboard url in a webview
          webview = WKWebView()
          let whiteboardUrl = whiteboard.url
          let request = URLRequest(url: whiteboardUrl)
          webView.load(request)
          // show the webview in app UI
          ...
          break
      case .stopped:
          // close the webview
          webView.removeFromSuperview()
          webview = nil
          break
      @unknown default:
          break
  }
}
```

You can see above that the HMSWhiteboard object that you get in the WhiteboardUpdateListener callback has a url property. You load this url in a WKWebview to show the whiteboard.
Note: It's crucial to close the WebView when the whiteboard session is stopped to release resources.

## Starting and Stopping the Whiteboard

The shared whiteboard can be started and stopped in the room using the startWhiteboard() and stopWhiteboard() methods.

```swift

// Start whiteboard
sdk.interactivityCenter.startWhiteboard() { success, error in
    if let error = error {
        // handle error
    }
}

// Stop whiteboard
sdk.interactivityCenter.stopWhiteboard() { success, error in
    if let error = error {
        // handle error
    }
}
```

Note: Please note that you don't need any additional handling to start/stop the whiteboard. The WhiteboardUpdateListener will get called upon calling startWhiteboard() and stopWhiteboard() APIs. Thus showing/hiding of WebView is already taken care of in one place.

## How to know if whiteboard feature is enabled/available in the current room

After joining the room you can check isWhiteboardEnabled property on the interactivityCenter like below:

```swift
func on(join room: HMSRoom) {
    let isWhiteboardEnabled = hmsSDK.interactivityCenter.isWhiteboardEnabled
    ...
}
```


## How to know if a role is allowed to show/hide whiteboard

Every peer has a role assigned. This HMSRole object contains whiteboard permissions in a whiteboard permission object. You can check what whiteboord permissions the current user has like below:

```swift
let userRole = localPeer.role
let whiteboardPermissions = userRole.permissions.whiteboard
let isUserAdmin = whiteboardPermissions.admin
let canWrite = whiteboardPermissions.write
let canRead = whiteboardPermissions.read
```
