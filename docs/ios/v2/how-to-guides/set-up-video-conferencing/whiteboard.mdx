100ms SDK provides APIs to support whiteboard collaboration during a conferencing session. Participants can draw, write and collaborate on a common digital whiteboard in real-time. You can start and stop a whiteboard and show it in a WebView.

## Minimum Requirements

- Minimum 100ms SDK version required is 1.9.0
- For user to be able to start or view the whiteboard, their role must have the whiteboard functionality enabled in the 100ms dashboard.

## How to show the shared whiteboard in the room?

To show the whiteboard in your app, you listen to whiteboard updates using interactivity center's WhiteboardUpdateListener like below:

```swift

let webview: WKWebView?
...

sdk.interactivityCenter.addWhiteboardUpdateListener { [weak self] whiteboard, updateType in
  switch updateType {
      case .started:

          webview = WKWebView()
          let whiteboardUrl = whiteboard.url
          let request = URLRequest(url: whiteboardUrl)
          webView.load(request)

          break
      case .stopped:
          self.whiteboard = nil
          webview = nil
          break
      @unknown default:
          break
  }
}
```

The HMSWhiteboard object that you get here has a url property. You can load this url in a WKWebview to show the whiteboard like shown above.

That's all you have to do to show the room's whiteboard.

## How to start/stop shared whiteboard in the room?

You call startWhiteboard() and stopWhiteboard() to start and stop the shared whiteboard in the conference room. Please note that you don't need any additional handling to start/stop the whiteboard because the WhiteboardUpdateListener will get called upon calling startWhiteboard() and stopWhiteboard() APIs. Thus showing/hiding of webview is already taken care of in one place.


```swift

// Start whiteboard
sdk.interactivityCenter.startWhiteboard() { success, error in
    if let error = error {
        // handle error
    }
}

// Stop whiteboard
sdk.interactivityCenter.stopWhiteboard() { success, error in
    if let error = error {
        // handle error
    }
}
```
