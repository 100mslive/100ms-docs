title: Music Mode (Beta)
nav: 4.91

Use music mode to enable high quality audio streaming. This is useful when you have a use-case of streaming music that's getting captured through the mic.

## Minimum Requirements

-   Minimum 100ms SDK version required is 0.9.3

## What is Music Mode?

By default, the audio is pre-processed to cater to human voice by applying voice processing methods like noise cancellation, automatic gain control etc. Also, a 32 Kbps max-bandwidth is assinged for audio to keep with bandwidth low. If you have music playing in the background, it gets suppressed and does not come out in it's best quality. The music mode is a setting that removes voice-processing so that all type of frequencies get captured by the mic. It also makes the max-bandwidth limit for audio to 320 Kbps so that music doesn't get compressed too much.

## How to turn on Music Mode?

To enable Music Mode you have to do a couple of things:

1. You set kHMSAudioModeMusic as the audio-mode like below:

```swift
    sdk.trackSettings = HMSTrackSettings.build { videoSettingsBuilder, audioSettingsBuilder in
    audioSettingsBuilder.audioMode = .music
    ...
}
```

2. In the newer iPhones (iPhone XS onwards) make sure that 'Wide Spectrum' mic mode is selected in the control center. If you select 'Standard' or 'Voice Isolation' mode then your iPhone might apply voice processing on top to affect the music quality.
