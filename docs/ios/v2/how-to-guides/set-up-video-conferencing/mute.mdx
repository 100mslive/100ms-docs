An user should be able to mute or un-mute both audio & video as per their choice. 100ms SDK makes it simple to do just that in nifty way.

1. First, get the reference to local peer using the convenience method `localPeer` on `HMSSDK` class
2. Next, get the audio or video track of the local peer
3. Now, set it's mute status to true or false.

-   When mute is true, local peer won't transmit any audio or video. 🤫🤐
-   When mute is false, local peer can speak & show the world whatever they want to. 🕺💃

### Mute Audio 🙊

```swift
hmsSDK.localPeer?.localAudioTrack()?.setMute(true)
```

### Ummute Audio 🐵

```swift
hmsSDK.localPeer?.localAudioTrack()?.setMute(false)
```

### Mute Video 🙈

```swift
hmsSDK.localPeer?.localVideoTrack()?.setMute(true)
```

### Unmute Video 🐒

```swift
hmsSDK.localPeer?.localVideoTrack()?.setMute(false)
```

Note: Ensure that you call these functions from the main queue.
