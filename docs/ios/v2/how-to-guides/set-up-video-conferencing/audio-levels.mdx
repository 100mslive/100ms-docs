## Audio Level

The audio level for every speaking peer can be retrieved by listening to 'onUpdatedSpeakers' callback in 'HMSUpdateListener', like so.

```swift
public func on(updated speakers: [HMSSpeaker]) {
    if let firstSpeakingPeer = speakers.first {
        let audioLevel = firstSpeakingPeer.level
        // Use this audio level
        // level : `Int`. The level of the audio. It may vary from 0-100. A higher value indicates a higher speaking volume.
        ...
    }
}
```

Note: on(updated speakers) is called when set of speaking peers change in the conference call. These are called active speakers. If you'd live to know the current dominant speaker you can look at the audio level to check who is the loudest at a given moment.
