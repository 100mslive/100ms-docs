Previously, you had to implement **handRaise** functionality with peer metadata. But that is no more required. We have made raising/lowering hand as **first class API** on HMSSDK.

## How to raise hand

```swift
hmsSDK.raiseLocalPeerHand() { success, error in
    // handle error if any
}
```

## How to lower hand

```swift
hmsSDK.lowerLocalPeerHand() { success, error in
    // handle error if any
}
```

## How to lower hand of remote peer

```swift
let remotePeer: HMSPeer
hmsSDK.lowerRemotePeerHand(remotePeer) { success, error in
    // handle error if any
}
```

## How to know when a peer raises hand

Listen to callbacks when local  or remote peerâ€™s hand raise status is changed in **on(peer:update:)** callback of **HMSUpdateListener**:

```swift
func on(peer: HMSPeer, update: HMSPeerUpdate) {
     if(update == .handRaiseUpdated) {
	// Update UI of hmsPeer
     }
}
```

Or you can use the new getter **isHandRaised** on **HMSPeer** to fetch the status of handRaise of any peer. **isHandRaised** property is added in **HMSPeer** to denote if hand is raised for the peer.

```swift
hmsPeer.isHandRaised
```

## How to get Total Peer count of the room

Use **peerCount** property of HMSRoom to get the latest peer count of the room. Whenever peer count is udated, SDK sends a **peerCountUpdated** notification to the app in **on(room:update:)** as well.

```swift
func on(room: HMSRoom, update: HMSRoomUpdate) {
     if(update == .peerCountUpdated) {
	// Update UI of peer count
     }
}
```

# Supporting Large Scale Room

You don't want to fetch every peer if the room is very large, use the peer list iterator instead.

## How to get peer list iterator in a large room

You call **getPeerListIterator** method on **HMSSDK** instance to get **HMSPeerListIterator**.

```swift
let options = HMSPeerListIteratorOptions(filterByRoleName: nil, filterByPeerIds: nil, limit: 10)
let peerListIterator = hmsSDK.getPeerListIterator(options: options)
```

If you wish to filter peers based on role name or peer ids, you can pass them in **HMSPeerListIteratorOptions**. **limit** is the number of peers you want to fetch in one go.

Now with **peerListIterator** instance you can incremently load peers, or check peer count without fetching the peers.

## How to use peer iterator to load peers incremently

You can use **next** method on **HMSPeerListIterator** to fetch the next set of peers, with the filters applied while creating the `peerListIterator`.

```swift
peerListIterator.next() { loadedPeers, error in
    if let loadedPeers = loadedPeers {
       // store newly loaded peers to show in UI
    }
}
```

### How to check if more peers are available to load

You use **hasNext** property on **HMSPeerListIterator** to check if there are more peers available to fetch.

```swift
if peerListIterator.hasNext {
    // load next set of peers
}
```

### How to check the total count of peers in the peer list

You use **totalCount** property on **HMSPeerListIterator** to know how many peers are there in the peer list.

```swift
let totalPeerCount = peerListIterator.totalCount
```
