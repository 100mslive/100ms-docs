title: Remove Peer
nav: 7.24

Someone's overstayed their welcome and now you need to remove a peer from the chat. Just call `hmsSdk.removePeerRequest`.

### Permissions

Can't let just anyone remove others from the room. First you need to create a [role](/get-started/v2/get-started/concepts/templates-and-roles) with the permissions to end a room.

The permission to end a room is called `removeOthers` and you should check for that within the `permissions` property of `HMSRole` of the peer to see if they have it.

### Removing a peer

Once the permissions are checked to ensure the caller has the permission to remove a peer...

Remove them by calling `hmsSdk.removePeer`.

The parameters are:

peer: The `HMSRemotePeer` that you'd like to be removed from the room.

reason: Optional message you want to pass along the peer being removed

completion handler: Let you know whether the remove operation executed successfully or not.

```swift
hmssdk.removePeer(targetPeer, reason: "You are violating the community rules.") { success, error in
}
```

### Handling the remove peer callback

The target peer of the `removePeer` will receive a callback in `HMSUpdateListener` of `onRemovedFromRoom(notification : HMSRemovedFromRoom)`.

The `HMSRemovedFromRoom` object which is passed into the callback has the structure:

```swift
class HMSRemovedFromRoomNotification {
    public let requestedBy: HMSPeer
    public let reason: String
    public let roomEnded: Bool
}
```

> ðŸ’¡ This is the same callback that will be triggered if a room was [ended](../room/end-room) as well. Except that `roomEnded` will be false.

reason: The string message detailing why the peer is being removed.

requestedBy: The details of the peer who called `removePeer`.

roomEnded: True if the entire room was ended. False if only the receiving peer was removed.

Clients should read this callback and show the appropriate UI.

You call `remove(peer, withReason:)` method on `HMSRoomModel` instance to remove a remote participant.
```swift
try await roomModel.remove(peer: /* peer model instance*/, withReason reason: /* an optional string describing the reason for ending the session for everyone*/)
```

    <summary>Code in context</summary>
```swift
guard let studentPeerModel = (roomModel.peerModels.first{$0.name == "Pawan"}) else { return }
try await roomModel.remove(peer: studentPeerModel, withReason: "Expelled from class.")
```
</details>

### How to check whether you were removed from the room
You check the `roomState` property on `HMSRoomModel` instance and see if it's set to `leftMeeting(reason: LeaveReason)` enum, and the LeaveReason is set to `removedFromRoom`.

```swift
struct MeetingView: View {
    
    @ObservedObject var roomModel = HMSRoomModel(roomCode: "qdr-mik-seb")
    
    var body: some View {
        
        switch roomModel.roomState {
        case .notJoined:
            // Button to join the room
            ...
        case .inMeeting:
            VStack {
                // Button to leave the room
                ...
            }
        case .leftMeeting(reason: let leaveReason):
            if case .removedFromRoom(reasonString: _) = leaveReason {
                // show a view to let user know that they were kicked out of the room
            }
        }
    }
}
```

where leave reasons can be following:
```swift
public enum LeaveReason {
    case roomEnded
    case youLeft
    case removedFromRoom
}
```
</Tab>
