Any peer can change their own name before or after joining a room.

<Tabs

<Tab id='sample-code-0'>
Before joining, the name would have to be specified in `HMSConfig` that is passed to the join method. This document shows how the name can be changed after joining.

## Responding to name changes

Whenever a remote peer's name is changed a callback will be received in `on(peer: HMSPeer, update: HMSPeerUpdate)` of `HMSUpdateListener` where the `update` will be of type `HMSPeerUpdate.nameUpdated`.

When this callback is received the UI for that peer should be updated as well.

## Changing the name

The peer who wants to change their name should call the following method on an `HMSSDK` instance.

```swift
let newName = "Ashwini Shetty"
hmsSdk.change(name: newName) { success, error in
   ...
}
```

<Tab id='sample-code-1'>
Before joining, the name would have to be passed a parameter to `joinSession` call or `HMSRoomModel` initializer. This document shows how the name can be changed after joining.

## Changing the name

The peer who wants to change their name should call the following method on an `HMSRoomModel` instance.

```swift
let newName = "Pawan Dixit"
try await roomModel.changeUserName(to: newName)
```

## Responding to name changes
Whenever a remote peer's name is changed, it's peer model's `name` property changes. Because it's published property, it should automatically reflect in your UI.
