## Pre-Call Diagnostic APIs

The Pre-Call Diagnostic APIs provide two type of functionalities :
1. APIs to test the connected I/O devices like camera, mic and speaker functionality
2. APIs to test the connectivity to 100ms Servers - This can identify signaling and media connectivity issues and provide a report at the end of the test.

You can use these APIs in your application to detect issues before a Participant joins a video Room or as part of a troubleshooting page while already joined in the room or at a later stage to debug some issues at the end user's device/network

## How to use the Pre-Call Diagnostic APIs

To use the diagnostic APIs first you need to get an instance of `HMSDiagnostics` from the `HMSSDK` instance.
```swift
            // get the HMSSDK instance
            var hmsSDK = HMSSDK.build()
            var diagnosticsSDK = hmsSDK.getDiagnosticsSDK()

```
If you are planning to use the connectivity checks while you have already joined a room, create a new instance of `HMSSDK` to get the `HMSDiagnostics` instance

## Test Microphone

To test if the microphone is correctly working, call the `startMicCheck` API passing the preferred check duration as `timeInMillis` parameter. Diagnostics SDK will record the microphone input into a temporary file.
`completion` callback will be called with the result of the check or error if any.
`onLevelChange` is called every second with the decibel level detected by the microphone. This can be used on the UI to show an indication that mic is recording user's audio

Ensure app has NSMicrophoneUsageDescription set before running this check.

```swift
        diagnosticsSDK.startMicCheck(timeInMillis: 10000) { [weak self] result in
            switch result {
            case .success:
                // recording succeeded
            case .failure(let error):
                // error occured during recording
            }
        } onLevelChange: {  [weak self] level in
            self?.micLevel = level
        }

```

You can call `stopMicCheck` if you need to interrupt the check before the specified time has passed.

## Test Speaker
To test the device speaker phone, call the `startSpeakerCheck` API. This will playback the file that was recorded while testing mic.
If there is no recorded file present in the cache, either due to microphone issues or `startMicCheck` not being called, the speaker test API will play a pre-recorded file

You can check if the speaker is working correctly if you are able to properly listen to the recording from `startMicCheck` API or the pre recorded file
```swift
        diagnosticsSDK.startSpeakerCheck { [weak self] result in
            switch result {
            case .success:
                // playback succeeded
            case .failure(let error):
                // error occured during playback
            }
        }

```

To stop the speaker check, call the `stopSpeakerCheck` API.

## Test Camera
To check if the camera on the device is working fine, call the `startCameraCheck` API. This API creates a local video track and returns it. 
Applications can use `HMSVideoView` to show the video track to users, using the same way any other `HMSVideoTrack` is shown.
This API takes the `device` as a parameter, where you can specify either the front or back camera. By default front camera is chosen if nothing is specified


Ensure app has NSCameraUsageDescription set before running this check.

```swift
        var device: HMSVideoInputDevice
        
        switch selectedCamera {
        case "Back Camera":
            device = .backCamera
        default:
            device = .frontCamera
        }
        
        diagnosticsSDK.startCameraCheck(device: device) { [weak self] result in
            switch result {
            case .success(let track):
                // Use HMSVideoView to render the resulting track
            case .failure(let error):
                // Show error
            }
        }

```


To stop the camera check and release all the resources, call `stopCameraCheck` API


## Test Connectivity to 100ms Servers
To test if there is proper connectivity to 100ms signalling and media servers, you have to call the `startConnectivityCheck` API. This API establishes connections to both the signalling and media server and publishes audio and video data to determine the network quality and generates a report of the connection.
This API uses the local device's mic and camera to send audio-video data and receives back the same data to calculate network stats for both upload and download link of user's network.
Please note that Camera and microphone permissions are needed to be provided by the app before making a call to this API
This test runs for `20 seconds`. It may finish earlier if connection cannot be established.

While the connectivity test is being performed, regular updates are sent by the SDK via the `progress` closure. The application can listen to these updates and notify the UI to show updates regarding the test.
When the test is completed, `completion` closure is executed with the complete `HMSConnectivityCheckResult` that has details about all the reports generated.


```swift
        diagnosticsSDK.startConnectivityCheck(region: region) { [weak self] checkState in
            // Show state updates to the user
        } completion: { [weak self] result in
            // Show check results
        }

```


## Understanding ConnectivityState updates
The `startConnectivityCheck` API sends regular updates while the test is going on. `HMSConnectivityCheckState` is an enum which has the following states:

```swift
           enum HMSConnectivityCheckState : Int {
            case starting
            case initFetched
            case signallingConnected
            case iceEstablished
            case mediaCaptured
            case mediaPublished
            case completed
           }

```
