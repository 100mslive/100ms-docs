title: Noise Cancellation (Beta)
nav: 12.4
---

The Noise Cancellation is useful when you want to cancel noise and unwanted sudden audio like clicks, claps, barking etc. from the mic audio in a conference or live stream. This feature uses an AI model to cancel noise.

## How to integrate noise cancellation AI model in your app

100ms provides ready made noise cancellation models packaged in HMSNoiseCancellationModels SDK to make it very easy to integrate with your app. Follow these steps:

1. Add HMSNoiseCancellationModels SDK into your app using either SPM or Cocoapods https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-noise-cancellation-models-ios
2. import HMSNoiseCancellationModels in your project file
3. Now you can get path to the noise cancellation AI model using HMSNoiseCancellationModels.path(for: .smallFullBand).

```swift
import HMSNoiseCancellationModels

let pathForNCModel = HMSNoiseCancellationModels.path(for: .smallFullBand)
```

## Minimum Requirements
-   Minimum 100ms SDK version required is `1.7.0`

**IMPORTANT** <br/>
Enable Noise Cancellation in the template configuration. Learn more on enabling this feature from [here](/get-started/v2/get-started/features/noise-cancellation#enabling-the-noise-cancellation)
</Note>

## How to enable noise cancellation in your app

To enable noise cancellation, you need HMSNoiseCancellationPlugin. Initialise HMSNoiseCancellationPlugin using this path to the AI model. You also pass the initial state of noise cancellation plugin as well.

```swift
import HMSNoiseCancellationModels

...

var noiseCancellationPlugin: HMSNoiseCancellationPlugin? = {
     if let pathForNCModel = HMSNoiseCancellationModels.path(for: .smallFullBand) {
          return HMSNoiseCancellationPlugin(modelPath: pathForNCModel, initialState: .enabled)
     }
     else {
          assertionFailure("noise cancellation model was not found")
     }
     return nil
}()

```

Once you have HMSNoiseCancellationPlugin instance pass it to audioSettings of hmsSDK instance like below:

```swift
hmsSDK = HMSSDK.build { sdk in

     sdk.trackSettings = HMSTrackSettings.build { videoSettingsBuilder, audioSettingsBuilder in

          audioSettingsBuilder.noiseCancellationPlugin = self.noiseCancellationPlugin
     }
}
```

```swift
import HMSNoiseCancellationModels

...

var noiseCancellationPlugin: HMSNoiseCancellationPlugin? = {
     if let pathForNCModel = HMSNoiseCancellationModels.path(for: .smallFullBand) {
          return HMSNoiseCancellationPlugin(modelPath: pathForNCModel, initialState: .enabled)
     }
     else {
          assertionFailure("noise cancellation model was not found")
     }
     return nil
}()

...

hmsSDK = HMSSDK.build { sdk in

     sdk.trackSettings = HMSTrackSettings.build { videoSettingsBuilder, audioSettingsBuilder in

          audioSettingsBuilder.noiseCancellationPlugin = self.noiseCancellationPlugin
     }
}
```
</details>

That is all you need to do to add noise cancellation plugin to your conferecing or livestreaming!

## How to enable/disable noise cancellation

You call enable() or disable() API on noiseCancellationPlugin to enable disable noise cancellation. Additionally, you can call isEnabled() method to check if noise cancellation is enabled.

```swift
// Enable noise cancellation
try noiseCancellationPlugin.enable()

// Disable noise cancellation
try noiseCancellationPlugin.disable()

// Check if noise cancellation is enabled
let isnoiseCancellationEnabled = noiseCancellationPlugin.isEnabled()
```

## How to check if noise cancellation is enabled in the room

To make noise cancellation work your room needs to have noise cancellation feature enabled. You can check if noise cancellation is enabled using isNoiseCancellationAvailable property on noiseCancellationPlugin. To enable noise canellation in your rooms, reach out to support@100ms.live or 100ms discord.

```swift
let isNoiseCancellationAvailableInTheRoom = noiseCancellationPlugin.isNoiseCancellationAvailable
```

Note: You can call this API to check the state of noise cancellation only after successfully joining the room.

## Minimum Requirements
-   Minimum HMSRoomModels SDK version required is `1.5.0`

## How to enable noise cancellation in your app

To enable noise cancellation, while instantiating HMSRoomModel, you pass an instance of HMSNoiseCancellation in HMSRoomOptions.

```swift
import HMSNoiseCancellationModels

@ObservedObject var roomModel = HMSRoomModel(options: HMSRoomOptions(...noiseCancellation: .init(with: HMSNoiseCancellationModels.path(for: .smallFullBand)!, initialState: .enabled))
```

That is all you need to do to add noise cancellation plugin to your conferecing or livestreaming!

## How to enable/disable noise cancellation

You call roomModel.toggleNoiseCancellation() API to enable/disable noise cancellation. Additionally, you can use roomModel.isNoiseCancellationEnabled to check if noise cancellation is enabled.

```swift
roomModel.toggleNoiseCancellation()
roomModel.isNoiseCancellationEnabled
```

## How to check if noise cancellation is enabled in the room

To make noise cancellation work your room needs to have noise cancellation feature enabled. You can check if noise cancellation is enabled using roomModel.isNoiseCancellationAvailable. 
```swift
roomModel.isNoiseCancellationAvailable
```
