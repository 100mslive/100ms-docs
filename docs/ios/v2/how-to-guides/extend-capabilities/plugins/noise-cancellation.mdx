The HMSNoiseCancellationPlugin is an audio filter plugin that you can use to cancel noise and unwanted sudden audio like clicks, claps, barking etc. from the mic audio in a conference or live stream.

## Minimum Requirements
-   Minimum 100ms SDK version required is `1.7.0`

## How to add HMSNoiseCancellationPlugin plugin in your app

HMSNoiseCancellationPlugin uses a noise cancelling AI model. 100ms provides a HMSNoiseCancellationModels SDK to make it very easy. Follow these steps:

1. Add HMSNoiseCancellationModels SDK into your app using either SPM or Cocoapods
2. import HMSNoiseCancellationModels in your project file
3. Now you can create HMSNoiseCancellationPlugin and add it to audioSettings of hmsSDK instance like below:

```swift
import HMSNoiseCancellationModels

...

var noiseCancellationPlugin: HMSNoiseCancellationPlugin?

...

hmsSDK = HMSSDK.build { sdk in

     sdk.trackSettings = HMSTrackSettings.build { videoSettingsBuilder, audioSettingsBuilder in

          if let pathForNCModel = HMSNoiseCancellationModels.path(for: .smallFullBand) {
               self.noiseCancellationPlugin = HMSNoiseCancellationPlugin(modelPath: pathForNCModel, initialState: .enabled)
          }
          else {
               assertionFailure("noise cancellation model was not found")
          }

          audioSettingsBuilder.noiseCancellationPlugin = self.noiseCancellationPlugin
     }
}
```

That is all you need to do to add noise cancellation plugin to your conferecing or livestreaming!

## How to enable/disable noise cancellation

You call enable() or disable() API on noiseCancellationPlugin to enable disable noise cancellation. Additionally, you can call isEnabled() method to check if noise cancellation is enabled.

```swift
     // Enable noise cancellation
     try noiseCancellationPlugin.enable()

     // Disable noise cancellation
     try noiseCancellationPlugin.disable()

     // Check if noise cancellation is enabled
     let isnoiseCancellationEnabled = noiseCancellationPlugin.isEnabled()
```

## How to check if noise cancellation is enabled in the room

To make noise cancellation work your room needs to have noise cancellation feature enabled. You can check if noise cancellation is enabled using isNoiseCancellationAvailable property on noiseCancellationPlugin.

```swift
     let isNoiseCancellationAvailableInTheRoom = noiseCancellationPlugin.isNoiseCancellationAvailable
```
