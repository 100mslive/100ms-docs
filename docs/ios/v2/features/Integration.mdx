HMSSDK is distributed via [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/). Add the `pod 'HMSSDK'` to your Podfile as follows:
  
  ```
  // Podfile
  
  platform :ios, '10.0'

  target 'MyAwesomeApp' do
    pod 'HMSSDK'
  end
  ```

Currently the SDK does not support bitcode so we need to disable it in build settings.

Add the entitlements for video, audio and network access to your `Info.plist`

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow access to Camera to enable video calling.</string>
<key>NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow access to Camera to network to enable video calling.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow access to Camera to mic to enable video calling.</string>
```
