Leaving a room should be quick. Once a user wishes to end their interaction in the room, they can choose to leave the meeting. 👋

100ms SDK provides a simple, no fuss API to do exactly that. Invoke the `leave` method on instance of `HMSSDK`.

```swift
hmsSDK.leave()
```

You should expect that the `leave` function always succeeds, even in scenarios like "No Internet Connection", "Low Battery", etc
