title: Call Stats
nav: 3.97
---

Sometimes you need a way to capture certain metrics related to a call. This may be helpful if you want to tailor the experience to your users or debug issues. Typical metrics of interest are audio/video bitrate, round trip time, total consumed bandwidth and packet loss. 100ms SDK provides this data via dedicated delegate callbacks found in `HMSUpdateListener`. These will be called with a fixed interval of one second after a room has been joined. You can get stats on a per track basis ( `on(remoteAudioStats:track:peer)`) or as an overall summary (`on(rtcStats:)`) 

Here is the full list of callbacks:

```swift
/// This callback provides stats for a local audio track.
optional func on(localAudioStats: HMSLocalAudioStats, track: HMSLocalAudioTrack, peer: HMSPeer)

/// This callback provides stats for a local video track.
optional func on(localVideoStats: HMSLocalVideoStats, track: HMSLocalVideoTrack, peer: HMSPeer)

/// This callback provides stats for a remote audio track.
optional func on(remoteAudioStats: HMSRemoteAudioStats, track: HMSRemoteAudioTrack, peer: HMSPeer)

/// This callback provides stats for a remote video track.
optional func on(remoteVideoStats: HMSRemoteVideoStats, track: HMSRemoteVideoTrack, peer: HMSPeer)

/// This callback provides combined stats for the session.
optional func on(rtcStats: HMSRTCStatsReport)
```

## HMSRTCStatsReport

This class will contain the combined stats for the room.

```swift
class HMSRTCStats {
	// Total bytes sent in the current session.
	var bytesSent: UInt64
	// Total bytes received in the current session.
	var bytesReceived: UInt64
	// Total packets received in the current session.
	var packetsReceived: UInt64
	// Total packets lost in the current session.
	var packetsLost: UInt64
	// Total outgoing bitrate observed since previous report.
	var bitrateSent: Double
	// Total incoming bitrate observed since previous report in Kb/s.
	var bitrateReceived: Double
	// Average round trip time observed since previous report in seconds.
	var roundTripTime: Double
}

class HMSRTCStatsReport {
	// Combined audio + video values
	var combined: HMSRTCStats
	// Summary of all audio tracks
	var audio: HMSRTCStats
	// Summary of all video tracks
	var video: HMSRTCStats
}
```

## HMSLocalAudioStats

This class contains stats related to local audio track.

```swift
class HMSLocalAudioStats {
	// Round trip time observed since previous report.
	var roundTripTime: Double
	// Total bytes sent by this track in the current session.
	var bytesSent: UInt64
	// Outgoing bitrate of this track observed since previous report in Kb/s.
	var bitrate: Double
}
```

## HMSLocalVideoStats

This class contains stats related to local video track.

```swift
class HMSLocalVideoStats {
	// Round trip time observed since previous report.
	var roundTripTime: Double
	// Total bytes sent by this track in the current session.
	var bytesSent: UInt64
	// Outgoing bitrate of this track observed since previous report in Kb/s.
	var bitrate: Double
	// Resolution of video frames being sent.
	var resolution: HMSVideoResolution
	// Frame rate of video frames being sent (FPS).
	var frameRate: Double
}
```

## HMSRemoteAudioStats

This class contains stats related to remote audio track.

```swift
class HMSRemoteAudioStats {
	// Packet Jitter measured in seconds for this track. Calculated as defined in section 6.4.1. of RFC3550.
	var jitter: Double
	// Total bytes received by this track in the current session.
	var bytesReceived: UInt64
	// Incoming bitrate of this track observed since previous report in Kb/s.
	var bitrate: Double
	// Total packets received by this track in the current session.
	var packetsReceived: UInt64
	// Total packets lost by this track in the current session.
	var packetsLost: UInt64
}
```

## HMSRemoteVideoStats

This class contains stats related to remote video track.

```swift
class HMSRemoteVideoStats {
	// Packet Jitter measured in seconds for this track. Calculated as defined in section 6.4.1. of RFC3550.
	var jitter: Double
	// Total bytes received by this track in the current session.
	var bytesReceived: UInt64
	// Incoming bitrate of this track observed since previous report in Kb/s.
	var bitrate: Double
	// Total packets received by this track in the current session.
	var packetsReceived: UInt64
	// Total packets lost by this track in the current session.
	var packetsLost: UInt64
	// Resolution of video frames being received.
	var resolution: HMSVideoResolution
	// Frame rate of video frames being received (FPS).
	var frameRate: Double
}
