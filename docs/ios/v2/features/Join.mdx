title: Join Room

Joining a room is one of the most basic functionalities so we at 100ms have built an easy, developer friendly API to get you started.


A user can interact with participants of a room only after _joining_ the room.

When user indicates that they want to _join_ the room, your app should have -
1. User Name, the name which should be displayed to other peers in the room
2. User ID, a unique identifier for the user. Usually a [UUID string](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/uuid/1779712-uuidstring).
3. Room ID, the unique room identifier which would have been generated & passed to your app from backend
4. Authentication Token, the client side authentication token generated by your Token Service
 
Now that you have aforementioned data, you can proceed to join a room.

1. First, create an instance of `HMSSDK` class. Store this instance as a property. Ensure that the SDK object is alive in memory so that you can receive event callbacks from SDK. Simplest way to do this is as follows -
```swift
import HMSSDK

class MyMeetingClass {
    
    let hmsSDK: HMSSDK // store instance of HMSSDK as a property in your class

    init() {
        hmsSDK = HMSSDK.build() // initialize the SDK using the `build()` class function
    }
}
```
Note: If you are using Preview then you must already have an instance of HMSSDK before invoking Preview APIs.

2. Next, create an object of `HMSConfig` class using the available joining configurations
```swift
let config = HMSConfig(userName: "My good name",
                        userID: UUID().uuidString,
                        roomID: "abc123",
                        authToken: "eyJH5c")
```

3. Now, we are primed to join the room. All you have to do is pass the `config` object to `hmsSDK`
```swift
hmsSDK.join(config: config, delegate: self)
```

That's it. You have joined a room successfully. ü•≥

Now, let's take a look at the signature of the Join API
```swift
func join(config: HMSConfig, delegate: HMSUpdateListener)
```
As evident, `join` accepts 2 arguments - 
- `config`: an object of type `HMSConfig` class, the room configuration object which encapsulates user & token data
- `delegate`: a class conforming to `HMSUpdateListener` protocol. 

The methods of `HMSUpdateListener` are invoked to notify updates happening in the room like a peer joins/leaves, a track got muted/unmutes, etc.

After calling `join` your app will be provided an update from the 100ms SDK.

‚úÖ If successful, the `func on(join room: HMSRoom)` method of `HMSUpdateListener` will be invoked with information about the room encapsulated in the `HMSRoom` object. 

‚ùå If failure, the `func on(error: HMSError)` method will be invoked with exact failure reason.
