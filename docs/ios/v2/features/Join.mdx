Joining a room is one of the most basic functionalities so we at 100ms have built an easy, developer friendly API to get you started.


A user can interact with participants of a room only after _joining_ the room.

When user indicates that they want to _join_ the room, app should have -
1. User Name, the name which should be displayed to other peers in the room
2. User ID, a unique identifier for the user. Usually a [UUID string](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/uuid/1779712-uuidstring).
3. Room ID, the room identifier which would have been generated & passed to your app from backend
 
To join a room - 
1. Create an instance of the 100ms iOS SDK using the `build` class function of `HMSSDK` class
2. 
 create a `HMSConfig` object.

```swift
```
