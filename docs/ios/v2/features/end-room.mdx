Done with talking and it's time to end the call for everyone not just yourself? You may be looking to end the room.

### Permissions

Can't let just anyone end a call. First you need to create a [role](../foundation/templates-and-roles) with the permissions to end a room.

The permission to end a room is called `endRoom` and you should check for that within the `permissions` property of `HMSRole` of the peer to see if they have it.

 
### Ending the Room

Once you're sure the peer has the permissions to end the room they can call for the room to end when they're ready with `hmsSdk.endRoom`.

`endRoom` takes three parameters.

reason: Optional message you want to pass along the end room notification to other peers

lock: Whether you want to prevent anyone from rejoining the room. If false, they will be allowed to enter the room again if the client called `join`. If this is false, they will not able to join this room again.

completion handler: Lets you know whether the end room operation executed. was ended successfully or not. 

> 💡 After calling endRoom the local peer needs to dispose of the video calling UI as well.

```swift
hmssdk.endRoom(lock: false, reason: "Meeting is over") { success, error in
if (success) {
    // pop to previous screen
}
}
```

### How to handle an end room callback

Once the peer with adequate permissions calls `endRoom`, all other peers in the room will receive a callback in `HMSUpdateListener.onRemovedFromRoom`.

The `on(removedFromRoom:)` callback has a single parameter called `HMSRemovedFromRoomNotification` with the following structure.

```swift
class HMSRemovedFromRoomNotification {
    public let requestedBy: HMSPeer
    public let reason: String
    public let roomEnded: Bool
}
```

> 💡 This is the same callback that will be triggered if a peer was [removed from a room](Remove-Peer) as well. Except that `roomEnded` will be true when the entire room was ended.

reason: The string message detailing why the room was ended.

requestedBy: The details of the peer who called `endRoom`.

roomEnded: True if the entire room was ended. False if only the receiving peer was removed.

Clients should read this callback and show the appropriate UI.
