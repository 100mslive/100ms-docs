title: Remove Peer
nav: 3.94

Someone's overstayed their welcome and now you need to remove a peer from the chat. Just call `hmsSdk.removePeerRequest`.


### Permissions

Can't let just anyone remove others from the room. First you need to create a [role](../foundation/templates-and-roles) with the permissions to end a room.

The permission to end a room is called `removeOthers` and you should check for that within the `permissions` property of `HMSRole` of the peer to see if they have it.

### Removing a peer

Once the permissions are checked to ensure the caller has the permission to remove a peer, remove them by calling `hmsSdk.removePeer`.

The parameters are:

peer: The `HMSRemotePeer` that you'd like to be removed from the room.

reason: Optional message you want to pass along the peer being removed

completion handler: Let you know whether the remove operation executed successfully or not. 


```swift
hmssdk.removePeer(targetPeer, reason: "You are violating the community rules.") { success, error in
}
```

### Handling the remove peer callback

The target peer of the `removePeer` will receive a callback in `HMSUpdateListener` of `onRemovedFromRoom(notification : HMSRemovedFromRoom)`.

The `HMSRemovedFromRoom` object which is passed into the callback has the structure:

```swift
class HMSRemovedFromRoomNotification {
    public let requestedBy: HMSPeer
    public let reason: String
    public let roomEnded: Bool
}
```

> 💡 This is the same callback that will be triggered if a room was [ended](End-Room) as well. Except that `roomEnded` will be false.

reason: The string message detailing why the peer is being removed.

requestedBy: The details of the peer who called `removePeer`.

roomEnded: True if the entire room was ended. False if only the receiving peer was removed.

Clients should read this callback and show the appropriate UI.
