 title: Change User Name

Any peer can change their own name before or after joining a room. Before joining, the name would have to be specified in `HMSConfig` that is passed to the join method. This document shows how the name can be changed after joining.

## Responding to name changes

Whenever a remote peer's name is changed a callback will be received in `on(peer: HMSPeer, update: HMSPeerUpdate)` of `HMSUpdateListener` where the `update` will be of type `HMSPeerUpdate.nameUpdated`.

When this callback is received the UI for that peer should be updated as well.

## Changing the name

The peer who wants to change their name should call the following method on an `HMSSDK` instance.

```swift
let newName = "Ashwini Shetty"
hmsSdk.change(name: newName) { success, error in
   ...
}
```
