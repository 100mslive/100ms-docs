Role is a powerful concept that takes a lot of complexity away in handling permissions and supporting features like breakout rooms. [Learn more about roles here.](../foundation/Roles-and-templates)

Each `HMSPeer` instance has a `role` property which returns an `HMSRole` instance. You can use this property to do following:

1. Check what this role is allowed to publish. I.e can it send video (and at what resolution)? can it send audio? can it  share screen? Who can this role subscribe to? (I.e student can only see the teacher's video) This is can be discovered by checking `publishSettings` and `subscribeSettings` properties
2. Check what actions this role can perform. i.e can it change someone else's current role, end meeting, remove someone from the room. This is can be discovered by checking `permissions` property

In certain scenarios you may want to change someone's role. Imagine an audio room with 2 roles "speaker" and "listener". Only someone with a "speaker" role can publish audio to the room while "listener" can only subscribe. Now at some point "speaker" may decide to nominate some "listener" to become a "speaker". This is where the `changeRole` API comes in.

To invoke the api you will need 2 things. An instance of `HMSPeer` of the peer who's role you want to change and the `HMSRole` instance for the target role.  All the peers that are in the current room are accessible via `peers` property of `HMSRoom` instance that you can get via `room` property of `HMSSDK` instance after successful room join. A list of all available roles in the current room can be accessed via `roles` property of `HMSSDK` 

Once you have both you can invoke

```swift
 hmsSDK.changeRole(for: targetPeer, role: targetRole)
```

If the change role succeeds you will get a 

```swift
func on(peer: HMSPeer, update: HMSPeerUpdate)
```

delegate callback with the the same peer you passed as targetPeer and a `roleUpdated` update type.

`changeRole` has an optional `force` parameter which is `false` by default meaning that `changeRole` is basically a polite request: "Would you like to change you role from listener to speaker?" which can be ignored by the other party. The way it works is the other party will first receive a 

```swift
func on(roleChangeRequest: HMSRoleChangeRequest)
```

delegate callback. At which point app can choose to show a prompt to the user asking for permission. If the user accepts, app should call 

```swift
hmsSDK.accept(changeRole: roleChangeRequest)
```

which completes the `changeRole` loop. Both parties will receive a `roleUpdated` callback so that they both can do necessary UI updates. Now the user actually becomes a speaker and the audio publishing will start automatically. 

Now lets imagine the newly nominated speaker is not behaving nicely and we want to move him back to listener without a prompt. This is where the `force` parameter comes in. When it is set to `true` the other party will not receive a confirmation `roleChangeRequest` but instead will straight away receive a new set of updated permissions and stop publishing. `roleUpdated` callback will still be fired so that the app can update the user's UI state.
