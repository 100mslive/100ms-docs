You can capture a snapshot of the video stream of a local or remote peer's video.

## Minimum Requirements

-   SDK version 0.5.5

## How to capture the snapshot

You show a peer's video track using HMSVideoView. To capture a snapshot, you call captureSnapshot method on HMSVideoView instance to get a UIImage containing a snapshot of the video stream:

```swift

var videoView = HMSVideoView()
...

// Capture snapshot
if let image = videoView.captureSnapshot() {
  // process the captured UIImage
  ...
}
  ```
