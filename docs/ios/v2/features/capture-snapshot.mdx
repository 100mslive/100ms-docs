You can capture a snapshot of current video frame from HMSVideoView showing local or remote peer's track.

## Minimum Requirements

-   SDK version 0.5.5

## How to capture the snapshot

You call captureSnapshot method on your HMSVideoView instance to get a UIImage containing the snapshot of current video frame being rendered:

```swift

var videoView = HMSVideoView()
...

// Capture snapshot
if let image = videoView.captureSnapshot() {
  // process the captured UIImage
  ...
}
  ```
