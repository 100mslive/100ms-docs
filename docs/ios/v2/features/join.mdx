title: Join Room
nav: 3.2
---

To join and interact with others in audio or video call, the user needs to join a `room`.

When user indicates that they want to _join_ the room, your app should have -

1. User Name - the name which should be displayed to other peers in the room.
2. [Authentication Token](../guides/token) - the client side authentication token generated by the Token Service.

We'll call the `join` method on `HMSSDK` object with a config containing above fields to join the room.

1. First, create an instance of `HMSSDK` class. Store this instance as a property. Ensure that the SDK object is alive in memory so that you can receive event callbacks from SDK. Simplest way to do this is as follows -
```swift
import HMSSDK

class MyMeetingClass {
    
    let hmsSDK: HMSSDK // store instance of HMSSDK as a property in your class

    init() {
        hmsSDK = HMSSDK.build() // initialize the SDK using the `build()` class function
    }
}
```

You can optionally set the initial audio/video state at the time of joining like below:

```
class MyMeetingClass {
    
    let hmsSDK: HMSSDK // store instance of HMSSDK as a property in your class

    init() {
        // initialize the SDK using the `build()` class function
        hmsSDK = HMSSDK.build() { sdk in
            sdk.trackSettings = HMSTrackSettings.build { videoSettingsBuilder, audioSettingsBuilder in
                videoSettingsBuilder.initialMuteState = .mute
            }
        }
    }
}
```

2. Next, create an object of `HMSConfig` class using the available joining configurations
```swift
let config = HMSConfig(userName: "John Doe",
                      authToken: "eyJH5c")
```

Optionally, you can use metadata param that can be used to attach any additional data associated with this user. You can access this data on this peer later using peer's metadata property.

```swift
let config = HMSConfig(userName: "John Doe",
                      authToken: "eyJH5c",
                      metadata: "{"avatar": "location/on/amazon/storage"}")
```

3. Now, we are primed to join the room. All you have to do is pass the `config` object to `hmsSDK`
```swift
hmsSDK.join(config: config, delegate: self)
```

That's it. You have joined a room successfully. ü•≥

Now, let's take a look at the signature of the Join API
```swift
func join(config: HMSConfig, delegate: HMSUpdateListener)
```
As evident, `join` accepts 2 arguments - 
- `config`: an object of type `HMSConfig` class, the room configuration object which encapsulates user & token data
- `delegate`: a class conforming to `HMSUpdateListener` protocol. 

The methods of `HMSUpdateListener` are invoked to notify updates happening in the room like a peer joins/leaves, a track got muted/unmutes, etc.

After calling `join` your app will be provided an update from the 100ms SDK.

‚úÖ If successful, the `func on(join room: HMSRoom)` method of `HMSUpdateListener` will be invoked with information about the room encapsulated in the `HMSRoom` object. 

‚ùå If failure, the `func on(error: HMSError)` method will be invoked with exact failure reason.
