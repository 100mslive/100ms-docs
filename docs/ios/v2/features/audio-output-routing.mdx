title: Audio Output Routing - Speaker and Earpiece (Beta)
nav: 3.987
---

If you want to give your users option to switch audio between speaker and earpiece, you use Audio Output Routing API. For example, you can implement an in-call speaker button that toggles between speaker and earpiece audio.

## Minimum Requirements

-   SDK version 0.5.1

## How to switch audio to a particular output device

You call **switchAudioOutput** method on HMSSDK instance passing in the HMSAudioOutputDevice that you would like to switch audio to. Like below:

```swift

// Switch audio to earpiece
hmsSDK.switchAudioOutput(to: .earpiece)

// Switch audio to speaker
hmsSDK.switchAudioOutput(to: .speaker)
  ```
  
Currently, there are only 2 HMSAudioOutputDevices available:

1. **speaker** - in-built speaker device
2. **earpiece** - in-built earpiece device


## Can I switch audio to audio output devices other than speaker and earpiece?

No. Currently _in-built speaker_ and _in-built earpiece_ are the only two supported devices. Although there is getAudioOutputDeviceList method on HMSSDK that you call to get all available audio output devices, but currently it will return just these 2 in-built audio output devices.

```swift
let availableAudioOutputDevices = hmsSDK.getAudioOutputDeviceList()
  ```
  
Note: In future getAudioOutputDeviceList may return other available audio devices.
