**I receive a warning: The app references non-public selectors in HMSSDK.framework when uploading build to App Store**

Occasionally, while uploading your app build to the Apple App Store, you may come across a warning message stating that "The app references non-public selectors in Payload/Company.app/Frameworks/HMSSDK.framework/HMSSDK: setInputImage:, setMaskImage". This warning has been known to pop up from time to time, and based on our past experiences, it appears to be a problem on Apple's end.

It's worth noting that this warning doesn't typically result in your app being rejected during the review process, so you can safely ignore it.
