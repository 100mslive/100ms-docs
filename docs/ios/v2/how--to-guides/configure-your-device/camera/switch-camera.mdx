## How to Switch Cameras in Video Calls Using the 100ms SDK

With the 100ms SDK, you can switch between using the front and back camera for your video calls. To do so, you need to set the **cameraFacing** setting in the **HMSVideoTrackSettings** when building the trackSettings for the SDK. The following code demonstrates how to set the camera facing to the back:

```swift
var hmsSDK: HMSSDK?
...

hmsSDK = HMSSDK.build { sdk in
  sdk.trackSettings = HMSTrackSettings.build { videoSettingsBuilder, audioSettingsBuilder in
    videoSettingsBuilder.cameraFacing = .back
    ...
  }
}
```

## How to toggle between cameras using 100ms SDK?

To toggle between the front and back cameras during a call, you can use the **switchCamera** method on the **HMSLocalVideoTrack** instance. The following code demonstrates how to toggle the camera:

```swift
if let localTrack = hmsSDK.localPeer?.videoTrack as? HMSLocalVideoTrack {
  localTrack.switchCamera()
}
```

## How to know when switch camera operation has been completed?

You can pass a completion handler to switchCamera method like below:

```swift
if let localTrack = hmsSDK.localPeer?.videoTrack as? HMSLocalVideoTrack {
  localTrack.switchCamera() { error in
      // Switch camera operation has been completed
  }
}
```

You can utilise this completion handler to time a transition effect while camera is switching for example.
