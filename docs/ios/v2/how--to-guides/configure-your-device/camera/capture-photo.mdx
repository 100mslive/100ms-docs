title: Capture Photo at Highest Resolution (Beta)
nav: 6.4
---

With this API you can take a high resolution photo from camera during a video call. You can optionally enable flash during the photo capture. This can be useful if you want to implement a remote KYC (know-your-customer) use-case to capture high quality photos of client's documents.

## Minimum Requirements

-   SDK version 0.6.3

## How is this different from taking a snapshot of video view during call?

This API utilizes the image processing capabilities of iOS device to take a high-resolution photo with stability and a shutter sound, similar to the native camera app. The iOS device enhances the quality of the image by removing blur and haziness. On the other hand, a snapshot or frame taken from a video may result in a low-resolution image due to the video quality setting for the call on your dashboard, and a random frame captured from a video has a possibility of being blurry.

## How can you capture high-resolution photo from camera with 100ms SDK

You call **captureImageAtMaxSupportedResolution** method on HMSLocalVideoTrack instance to get a UIImage as shown below:

```swift
let localVideoTrack = peer.localVideoTrack()
...

localVideoTrack.captureImageAtMaxSupportedResolution(withFlash: false) { image in
    // do something with the image
}
```
