# Getting Started - React UI Components

### Introduction

<Note type='warning'>

This library is still a work-in-progress and not production ready

</Note>

100ms' React SDK also provides a UI component library with a focus on creating beautiful video conferencing apps quickly and efficiently. 100ms' components are designed to be used with Tailwind CSS Utility classes.

### Vision

We have compiled repetitive UI components used to build 100ms' templates in an open-source library.

We know there are tons of UI component libraries available, but this helps us achieve -

-   A set of beautifully designed components by some of the world's best designers, which helps us and our clients build beautiful video-conferencing apps quickly
-   Uniformity and brand consistency across 100ms' own templates

This library has grown from internal use at 100ms. We will be open sourcing this library.

We are publishing interfaces for the most frequently used components first - `VideoTile` and `VideoList`

### Installing UI components

Our UI component library is housed in the same library as our React-SDK

```bash
npm install --save @100mslive/sdk-components@latest
```

### Theming and adding to your app

```jsx
import { HMSThemeProvider } from '@100mslive/sdk-components';

const Conference = () => {
    const hmsActions = useHMSActions();
    const hmsStore = useHMSStore();
    return (
        <HMSThemeProvider
            config={{
                theme: {
                    extend: {
                        fontFamily: {
                            body: 'Roboto'
                        },
                        colors: {
                            brand: {
                                main: '#2F80FF'
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }}>
            {/*
          Conference code goes here
        */}
        </HMSThemeProvider>
    );
};

const App = () => {
    return (
        <HMSRoomProvider>
            <Conference />
        </HMSRoomProvider>
    );
};
```

### Components

The best way to see our components in action currently is to see them in use in our sample edtech template [here](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-web-v2). Detailed documentation is coming soon
