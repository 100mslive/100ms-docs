## Overview

100ms is a cloud platform that allows developers to add video and audio conferencing to Web, Android and iOS applications. The platform provides REST APIs, SDKs, and helper tools that make it simple to capture, distribute, record, and render high-quality audio, video, and screen shares.

Any application built using 100ms' SDKs has 2 components

-   **Client**: Client-side code that runs in a browser or mobile app, set up by the developer using the 100ms' client-side SDKs. Client-side handles the majority of 100ms' functionality.
-   **Server**: Server-side code that provides services for token generation, room creation and webhooks for events and recordings.

## How 100ms Video Conferencing Applications Work

1. **Server creates a room**
    - Your server calls [100ms' Rooms API](/v2/server-side/Create-room#create-room-using-api) to create a room using a [server-side-token](/v2/server-side/Generate-server-side-token). After validating the token, 100ms returns a `room_id`, a unique identifier for a room which can be used later by clients
2. **Client gets an access token**
    - You client [requests a token from your server](/v2/server-side/Generate-client-side-token). This is typically achieved by an HTTP request from your client application to your server
3. **Client connects to a room**
    - Client then connects to the previously generated `room_id` by calling 100ms' SDK's join method
4. **Client joins a room, publishes their video and gets remote peers' tracks**
    - After successful `join`, 100ms' SDK provides methods to access peers/tracks/other data for the room.

Basic Concepts

-   `Room` - A room represents a real-time audio, video session, the basic building block of the 100ms Video SDK
-   `Track` - A track represents either the audio or video that makes up a peer's stream
-   `Peer` - A peer represents all participants connected to a room. Peers can be "local" or "remote"
-   `Broadcast` - A local peer can send any message/data to all remote peers in the room
