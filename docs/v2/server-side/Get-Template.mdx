## Introduction

Templates determine behaviour of roles in a particular room. They give you flexibility to determine behaviour of different roles on different devices.

The template you set while creating room is available to in the callback of init API while joining the room. You can determine person's behaviour in the room based on parameters set while creating the template.


## Get Template(s)

You can get template at [Templates section in Dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/templates). You can create new roles or modify previously created roles of a template.

Roles have following properties:
