### Introduction

We've put together a quick-start app server that will help you quickly get started with server side functions.

The quick-start app server has the following endpoint:

-   `/api/token` - You can generate a token required to join a room with this POST endpoint by providing `room_id`,`user_id` and `role` .

You can create room using [create room API](/v2/server-side/Create-room) or from [Create Room](https://dashboard.100ms.live/create-room) section on [100ms Dashboard.](https://dashboard.100ms.live) You can find `room_id` and `role` of the room created on dashboard in room details section.

### Creating room from Dashboard

### Room Details on Dashboard

Clicking on any of the room ids on [Rooms Page](https://dashboard.100ms.live/rooms) on Dashboard will take you to details page of that room.

`user_id` is the identifier for the user at your end. It can be any string.

### Token Generation endpoint

You can get the token generation endpoint from the [Developer](https://dashboard.100ms.live/developer) section of [100ms Dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/).

### Using Token Generation Endpoint in Quickstart apps

### Android

The endpoint you copied needs to be added as `TOKEN_ENDPOINT` in your app's `app/gradle.properties` file.

> Please add the `TOKEN_ENDPOINT`with the trailing slash `/`

### Web

Add it as`REACT_APP_TOKEN_GENERATION_ENDPOINT` in your app's .env file

> Please add the `REACT_APP_TOKEN_GENERATION_ENDPOINT` with the trailing slash `/`

### Limitations to Token Generation Endpoint

The token generation endpoint you get from dashboard is only for demo purpose and has following limitations:

-   For security purpose, it has only client token generation.
-   The token generation endpoint becomes invalid after your first 10K free minutes are over. We suggest you to setup your own server after that.
-   Token generation endpoint has ratelimit of 2000 requests per minute. If you foresee scale bigger than that, we suggest you to setup your own server.

In either of the above scenarios, we suggest you to set up your own app server.

### Setting up your own app server

We provide code snippet for [client](/v2/server-side/Generate-client-side-token) & [server side](/v2/server-side/Generate-server-side-token) tokens and API for [creating a room](/v2/server-side/Create-room). Using the code snippets of your chosen language & API you can build your APIs and host them on your servers.
