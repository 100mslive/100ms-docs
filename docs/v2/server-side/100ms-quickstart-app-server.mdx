# 100ms quickstart app server

### Introduction

We've put together a quick-start app server that will help you quickly get started with server side functions.

The quick-start app has two endpoints

-   `/api/room` - You can create a new room with this POST endpoint by providing a `name` for your room. Internally, this API generates the server side token
-   `/api/token` - You can generate a token required to join a room with this POST endpoint by providing `room_id`,`user_id` and `role` .

### Keys & Secrets

You can get following keys from the [Developer](https://dashboard.100ms.live/developer) section of [100ms Dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/).

-   `app_access_key` - You can generate unique access_keys for multiple access points.
-   `app_secret` - This unique secret is used to sign the token. This should ideally be stored server-side.

### Host a token generation endpoint

-   Clone [this runkit document](https://runkit.com/100mslive/100ms-quickstart-app-server)
-   Add the following environment variables in runkit [settings/environment](https://runkit.com/settings/environment) -
    -   `HMS_ACCESS_KEY` = `app_access_key`
    -   `HMS_SECRET` = `app_secret`

Publish your runkit and copy the endpoint URL \(click on it and copy the URL that opens\)

> Opening your published runkit endpoint in the browser gives error with `statusCode = 400`. Kindly ignore this error and move on to the next steps of implementation.

### Android

The endpoint you copied needs to be added as `TOKEN_ENDPOINT` in your app's `app/gradle.properties` file.

### Web

Append `/api/token` to the endpoint you copied and add it as`REACT_APP_TOKEN_GENERATION_ENDPOINT` in your app's .env file
