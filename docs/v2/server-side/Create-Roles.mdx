## Introduction

Roles define behaviour of participants in the video call. Some roles can have super powers like sharing screen or muting other roles, while other roles can be silent viewers in the video calls.

You can use roles to define template for your rooms.

## Create roles

You can create new roles or visit previously created roles on [Roles section in Dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/dashboard).

Roles have following properties:

**Publish strategies:**

-   **Can Publish Video** - when on, participant can join the room with video on. When off, participant joins the room with video off and can't turn it on during the call.
-   **Can Publish Audio** - when on, participant can join the room with audio on. When off, participant joins the room with audio off and can't turn it on during the call.
-   **Can Publish Screenshare** - when on, participant can't share their screen during the call.
-   **Video Quality** - If you're allowing a participant to publish their video, you can choose from `720p`, `480p`, `360p`, and `240p`
-   **Screenshare Quality**- If you're allowing a participant to publish their video, you can choose from `720p`, and `1080p`
