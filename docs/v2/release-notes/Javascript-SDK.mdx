## 0.0.112 - 2021-07-28

#### Added

-   Changing roles mid-call. Refer Usage
    -   [JavaScript SDK](../client-sdks/Getting-Started-Javascript#managing-roles)
    -   [Reactive Store](../client-sdks/Reactive-Store-Extension-to-the-JS-SDK#managing-roles)
    -   [React SDK](../web-frameworks/Getting-started-react#managing-roles)
-   BREAKING CHANGE: The interface of `HMSPeer` has been modified for users using the JavaScript SDK without the [Reactive Store](../client-sdks/Reactive-Store-Extension-to-the-JS-SDK).

```jsx
// Before
peer.role; // returns a string

// After
peer.role; // returns HMSRole

interface HMSRole {
    name: string;
    publishParams: PublishParams;
    subscribeParams: {
        subscribeToRoles: string[],
        maxSubsBitRate: number
    };
    permissions: {
        endRoom: boolean,
        removeOthers: boolean,
        stopPresentation: boolean,
        muteAll: boolean,
        askToUnmute: boolean,
        muteSelective: boolean,
        changeRole: boolean
    };
    priority: number;
}

export interface PublishParams {
    audio: {
        bitRate: number,
        codec: string
    };
    video: {
        bitRate: number,
        codec: string,
        frameRate: number,
        width: number,
        height: number
    };
    screen: {
        bitRate: number,
        codec: string,
        frameRate: number,
        width: number,
        height: number
    };
    allowed: string[];
}
```

-   BREAKING CHANGE: For users of the [Reactive Store](../client-sdks/Reactive-Store-Extension-to-the-JS-SDK) and [React SDK](../web-frameworks/Getting-started-react), the `HMSPeer` interface has been modified. Use `peer.roleName` instead of `peer.role` to obtain the name of a peer's role.

#### Fixed

-   Improved automatic detection of input/output devices.
-   Audio level update in Firefox due to wrong track ID.

### Known Issues

-   Safari on Mac gives echo with some wired headphones
-   With some bluetooth headphones(eg: OnePlus Bullets) with stereo output option, the default audioOutput doesn't work on windows.
    (Quick Fix: Change device to another option of same device)

[Refer Usage](../client-sdks/Getting-Started-Javascript#changing-mic-camera-before-during-the-call). Use audio output manager(`hms.getAudioOutput().setDevice()`) to override output devices. [Refer Usage](../client-sdks/Getting-Started-Javascript#managing-audio-ouput)

Thanks for your patience :\).

This release might still have bugs, some interfaces can change \(we will keep them to a minimum\)

This release has

-   Simplified SDK interfaces that can power a fully-featured video conferencing application
    -   `join`
    -   `leave`
    -   `getPeers, getLocalPeer` for tracks/peers/other data
-   Features not covered in this release
    -   Handling network disconnections \(disconnect from wi-fi to 4g ends the call\)
    -   Handling subscription network degradations
    -   Handling second order publish network degradations
    -   Detailed analytics
    -   Recording
-   Our sample app is currently a React edtech app to demonstrate how roles work, and also how our UI-components work. Documentation for these roles will be released soon
