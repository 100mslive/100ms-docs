    -   `join`
    -   `leave`
    -   `store` for tracks/peers/other data
-   Features not covered in this release

    -   Handling subscription network degradations
    -   Handling second order publish network degradations

-   Our sample app is currently an edtech app to demonstrate how roles work, and also how our UI-components work. Documentation for these UI-components will be released soon
