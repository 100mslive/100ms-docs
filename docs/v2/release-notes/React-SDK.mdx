    -   `join`
    -   `leave`
    -   `store` for tracks/peers/other data
-   Features not covered in this release
    -   Handling network disconnections \(disconnect from wi-fi to 4g ends the call\)
    -   Handling subscription network degradations
    -   Handling second order publish network degradations
    -   Detailed analytics
    -   Recording
-   Our sample app is currently an edtech app to demonstrate how roles work, and also how our UI-components work. Documentation for these UI-components will be released soon
