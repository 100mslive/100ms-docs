## Overview

In this overview the major steps involved in creating a demo project with the 100ms SDK will be laid out. Each section will be explained in more detail further ahead.

### Getting the video call joining link

The [100ms Dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/register) is how you can quickly try out creating a video conferencing call link and joining it. For production use cases though your own server will generate the joining links and manage user authentication. Direct use of the dashboard will stop working after 10k minutes of video calls and you'll need to setup your own server after.

For the purposes of this quickstart you can rely on only the 100ms dashboard. Sign up for the 100ms Dashboard [here](https://dashboard.100ms.live/register).

From either the dashboard, or your own server once implemented, you'll generate a video call link.

### From adding sdk depdency to joining calls
On the Android app:
1. Add the sdk dependencies
2. Create a login token to authenticate the user
3. Create an instance of the `HMSSDK
    * Show an optional of the user's audio video with the 100ms `hmssdk.preview`
4. Call `hmssdk.join` with the video call link to join the call.

### How to get audio and video
The audio for every person who joins the call is played by the SDK automatically when you have joined.

To see the person's video you need to create an instance of `org.webrtc.SurfaceViewRenderer` which can be taken from the library `implementation 'org.webrtc:google-webrtc:1.0.32006'`.


### How you know when people join or leave

The join method takes an interface called `HMSUpdateListener` which lets you know when peers join and leave the call, mute/unmute their audio and video and lots more.

The `HMSUpdateListener` has a callback which will be called when people join or leave `onPeerUpdate(type: HMSPeerUpdate, peer: HMSPeer)`. `HMSPeer` is object that represents a person in the call.


Here's the [server](todo add link) way and below is how you can login relying on the 100ms auth.

## Login

### Request

Here's how to get an auth token with 100ms's demo authentication
    1. Sign up to the dashboard.
    2. Get your video call link should look like `https://myname.app.100ms.live/meeting/correct-horse-battery`
    3. Send an http post request to `https://prod-in.100ms.live/hmsapi/get-token`
    4. With the header "subdomain" set to myname.app.100ms.live if your link was `https://myname.app.100ms.live/meeting/correct-horse-battery`
    5. For a link of the type `https://myname.app.100ms.live/meeting/correct-horse-battery` The body is json with the format `{"code": "correct-horse-battery", "user_id":"your-customer-id" }` the user_id can be any random string as well and you can create it with `UUID.randomUUID().toString(),`.

### Response

The 100ms server will respond with an auth token in the following json response format `{"token":"some-token-string"}`.
