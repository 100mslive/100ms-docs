This guide provides an overview of the key objects you'll use with 100ms iOS SDK to build a Live Audio/Video application.

### ‚òùÔ∏è Pre-requisites

-   Xcode 12 or higher
-   Support for iOS 10 or higher

### üöÇ Setup Guide

-   Host your token generation service [following this guide](/v2/server-side/Introduction-to-tokens)
-   Get Access Keys: Sign up on [https://dashboard.100ms.live/register](https://dashboard.100ms.live/register) & visit the Developer tab to get your access credentials
-   Generate a server-side token, follow the steps described here - [/v2/server-side/Generate-server-side-token](/v2/server-side/Generate-server-side-token)
-   Create a room, follow the steps described here - [/v2/server-side/Create-room](/v2/server-side/Create-room)
-   Generate a client-side token, follow the steps described here - [/v2/server-side/Generate-client-side-token](/v2/server-side/Generate-client-side-token)
-   Get the HMSSDK via [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/). Add the `pod 'HMSSDK'` to your Podfile as follows:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'

target 'MyAwesomeApp' do
  pod 'HMSSDK'
end
```

### üßê Key Concepts

-   `Room` - A room represents real-time audio, video session, the basic building block of the 100mslive Video SDK
-   `Track` - A track represents either the audio or video that makes up a stream
-   `Peer` - A peer represents all participants connected to a room. Peers can be "local" or "remote"
-   `Broadcast` - A local peer can send any message/data to all remote peers in the room

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Setup event listeners

100ms SDK provides callbacks to the client app about any change or update happening in the room after a user has joined by implementing `HMSUpdateListener`. These updates can be used to render the video on screen or to display other info regarding the room.

<Tabs id="event-lis" items={['Swift', 'Objective-C']} />

<Tab id='event-lis-0'>

```swift
protocol HMSUpdateListener {


    /// This will be called on a successful JOIN of the room by the user
    /// This is the point where applications can stop showing its loading state
    /// - Parameter room: the room which was joined
    func on(join room: HMSRoom)


    /// This is called when there is a change in any property of the Room
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - room: the room which was joined
    ///   - update: the triggered update type. Should be used to perform different UI Actions
    func on(room: HMSRoom, update: HMSRoomUpdate)


    /// This will be called whenever there is an update on an existing peer
    /// or a new peer got added/existing peer is removed.
    /// This callback can be used to keep a track of all the peers in the room
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - peer: the peer who joined/left or was updated
    ///   - update: the triggered update type. Should be used to perform different UI Actions
    func on(peer: HMSPeer, update: HMSPeerUpdate)


    /// This is called when there are updates on an existing track
    /// or a new track got added/existing track is removed
    /// This callback can be used to render the video on screen whenever a track gets added
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - track: the track which was added, removed or updated
    ///   - update: the triggered update type
    ///   - peer: the peer for which track was added, removed or updated
    func on(track: HMSTrack, update: HMSTrackUpdate, for peer: HMSPeer)


    /// This will be called when there is an error in the system
    /// and SDK has already retried to fix the error
    /// - Parameter error: the error that occured
    func on(error: HMSError)


    /// This is called when there is a new broadcast message from any other peer in the room
    /// This can be used to implement chat is the room
    /// - Parameter message: the received broadcast message
    func on(message: HMSMessage)

  
    /// This is called every 1 second with list of active speakers
    ///
    /// ## A HMSSpeaker object contains -
    ///    - HMSPeer: the peer who is speaking
    ///    - trackID: the track identifier which is emitting audio
    ///    - level: a number within range 1-100 indicating the audio volume
    ///
    /// A peer who is not present in the list indicates that the peer is not speaking
    ///
    /// This can be used to highlight currently speaking peers in the room
    /// - Parameter speakers: the list of speakers
    func on(updated speakers: [HMSSpeaker])

### ü§î How to listen to Track, Peer and Room updates?

The `HMS` SDK sends updates to the application about any change in `HMSPeer` , `HMSTrack` or `HMSRoom` via the callbacks in `HMSUpdateListener` . Application need to listen to the corresponding updates in `onPeerUpdate` , `onTrackUpdate` or `onRoomUpdate`

The following are the different types of updates that are emitted by the SDK

```
HMSPeerUpdate
    case PEER_JOINED A new peer joins the room
    case PEER_LEFT - An existing peer leaves the room
    case BECAME_DOMINANT_SPEAKER - A peer becomes a dominant speaker
    case NO_DOMINANT_SPEAKER - There is silence in the room (No speaker is detected)

HMSTrackUpdate
    case TRACK_ADDED - A new track is added by a remote peer
    case TRACK_REMOVED - An existing track is removed from a remote peer
    case TRACK_MUTED - An existing track of a remote peer is muted
    case TRACK_UNMUTED - An existing track of a remote peer is unmuted
    case TRACK_DESCRIPTION_CHANGED - The optional description of a track of a remote peer is changed
```

### üõ§ How to know the type and source of Track?

`HMSTrack` contain a field called `source` which denotes the source of the Track. `source` can have the following values - `regular` \(normal\), `screen` \(for screenshare\)and `plugin` \(for plugins\)

To know the type of track, check the value of `type` which would be one of the enum values - `AUDIO` or `VIDEO`

### ü§ù Provide joining configuration

To join a room created by following the steps described in the above section, clients need to create a `HMSConfig` instance and use that instance to call `join` method of `HMSSDK`

<Tabs id="join-config" items={['Swift', 'Objective-C']} />

<Tab id='join-config-0'>

```swift
  // Create a new HMSConfig object
  let config = HMSConfig(userName: user, // name of the user
                           userID: UUID().uuidString, // some unique identifier
                           roomID: room, // unique ID of the room which user wants to join
                        authToken: token) // authorisation token of the user
```

</Tab>
<Tab id='join-config-1'>

```objectivec
// Create a new HMSConfig object
HMSConfig *config = [[HMSConfig alloc] initWithUserName:@"userName"
                                                 userID:@"userID"
                                                 roomID:@"roomID"
                                              authToken:@"authToken"
                                    shouldSkipPIIEvents:YES
                                               metaData:@"someMetaData"
                                               endpoint:@"endpoint"];
```

</Tab>

### üôè Join a room

Use the HMSConfig and HMSUpdateListener instances to call the join method on the instance of HMSSDK created above. Once Join succeeds, all the callbacks keep coming on every change in the room and the app can react accordingly

<Tabs id="join-room" items={['Swift', 'Objective-C']} />

<Tab id='join-room-0'>

```swift
  // Basic Usage
  hms = HMSSDK.build() // ensure to keep an instance of HMSSDK alive in the class as an instance property
  let config = HMSConfig(userID: "userID", roomID: "roomID", authToken: "authToken")
  hms?.join(config: config, delegate: self)


  // Advanced Usage
  hms = HMSSDK.build { (hms) in
            hms.logLevel = .verbose
            hms.analyticsLevel = .verbose
            let videoSettings = HMSVideoTrackSettings(maxBitrate: 512,
                                                      maxFrameRate: 25,
                                                      cameraFacing: .front,
                                                      trackDescription: "Just a normal video track")
            let audioSettings = HMSAudioTrackSettings(maxBitrate: 32, trackDescription: "Just a normal audio track")
            hms.trackSettings = HMSTrackSettings(videoSettings: videoSettings, audioSettings: audioSettings)
            hms.logger = self
        }

  let config = HMSConfig(userName: "userName",
                           userID: "userID",
                           roomID: "roomID",
                        authToken: "authToken",
              shouldSkipPIIEvents: true,
                         metaData: "someMetaData",
                         endpoint: "wss://myWebSocketEndpoint/ws")

  hms?.join(config: config, delegate: self)
```

  </Tab>

<Tab id="join-room-1">

```objectivec
// ensure to keep an instance of HMSSDK alive in the class as an instance property
hms = [HMSSDK buildWithBlock:^(HMSSDK * _Nonnull) {
    // configure settings if required
}];

HMSConfig *config = [[HMSConfig alloc] initWithUserName:@"userName"
                                                     userID:@"userID"
                                                     roomID:@"roomID"
                                                  authToken:@"authToken"
                                        shouldSkipPIIEvents:YES
                                                   metaData:@"someMetaData"
                                                   endpoint:@"endpoint"];

[hms joinWithConfig:config delegate:self];
```

</Tab>

### üëã Leave Room

Call the leave method on the HMSSDK instance

<Tabs id="leave-room" items={['Swift', 'Objective-C']} />

<Tab id='leave-room-0'>

```swift
hms?.leave() // to leave a room
```

</Tab>

<Tab id='leave-room-1' >

```objectivec
[hms leave];
```

</Tab>

### üëå Get Peers/tracks data

`HMSSDK` has other methods which the client app can use to get more info about the `Room`, `Peer` and `Tracks`

<Tabs id="peer-room" items={['Swift', 'Objective-C']} />

<Tab id='peer-room-0' >

```swift
/// Returns the local peer, which contains the local tracks
var localPeer: HMSLocalPeer? { get }


/// Returns all remote peers in the room
var remotePeers: [HMSRemotePeer]? { get }


/// Returns the room which was joined
var room: HMSRoom? { get }
```

</Tab>

<Tab id="peer-room-1" >

```objectivec
/// Returns the local peer, which contains the local tracks
@property (nonatomic, readonly, strong) HMSLocalPeer * _Nullable localPeer;


/// Returns all remote peers in the room
@property (nonatomic, readonly, copy) NSArray<HMSRemotePeer *> * _Nullable remotePeers;


/// Returns the room which was joined
@property (nonatomic, readonly, strong) HMSRoom * _Nullable room;
```

</Tab>

### üôä Mute/Unmute Local Audio

Use the `HMSLocalAudioTrack` and `HMSLocalVideoTrack` to mute/unmute tracks

<Tabs id="mute-room" items={['Swift', 'Objective-C']} />{' '}

<Tab id='mute-room-0' >

```swift
class HMSLocalAudioTrack : HMSAudioTrack {

  var settings: HMSAudioTrackSettings

  func setMute(_ mute: Bool)
}
```

</Tab>

    var settings: HMSVideoTrackSettings

    func setMute(_ mute: Bool)

    func startCapturing()

    func stopCapturing()

}
```

</Tab>

<Tab id='video-room-1' >

```objectivec
@interface HMSLocalVideoTrack : HMSVideoTrack

@property (nonatomic, copy) HMSVideoTrackSettings *settings;

- (void)setMute:(BOOL)mute;

- (void)startCapturing;
- (void)stopCapturing;
- (void)switchCamera;

@end
```

</Tab>

### üõ§ HMSTracks Explained

`HMSTrack` is the super-class of all the tracks that are used inside `HMSSDK`. Its hierarchy looks like this -

```swift
  HMSTrack
      - AudioTrack
          - LocalAudioTrack
          - RemoteAudioTrack
      - VideoTrack
          - LocalVideoTrack
          - RemoteVideoTrack
```
  
## üéû Display a Track
  To display a video track, first get the `HMSVideoTrack` & pass it on to `HMSVideoView` using `setVideoTrack` function. Ensure to attach the `HMSVideoView` to your UI hierarchy.

  ```
  // The following code is a sample.

  // Get the video track to be displayed
  let track = peer.videoTrack  

  // Create a view for rendering video track and add to the UI hierarchy

  let videoView = HMSVideoView()
  videoView.setVideoTrack(track)
  view.addSubview(videoView)

  ```
  
## üì® Chat Messaging
  You can send a chat or any other kind of message from local peer to all remote peers in the room.
  
  To send a message first create an instance of `HMSMessage` object.
  
  Add the information to be sent in the `message` property of `HMSMessage`.
  
  Then use the `func send(message: HMSMessage)` function on instance of HMSSDK.
  
  When you(the local peer) receives a message from others(any remote peer), `func on(message: HMSMessage)` function of `HMSUpdateListener` is invoked.
  
  ```
    // following is an example implementation of chat messaging
  
    // to send a broadcast message
    let broadcast = HMSMessage(sender: "peerID", // the peerID of local peer, can be empty
                               time: "\(Date())", // the timestamp when message is being sent, can be empty
                               type: "chat", // the type of message, you can set it to any arbitary string value & use it to filter on your Chat UI
                               message: "my message") // the message information to be sent in string

    hmsSDK.send(message: broadcast) // hmsSDK is an instance of `HMSSDK` object
  
    // receiving messages
    // the object conforming to `HMSUpdateListener` will be invoked with `on(message: HMSMessage)`, add your logic to update Chat UI within this listener
    func on(message: HMSMessage) {
        let messageReceived = message.message // extract message payload from `HMSMessage` object that is received
        // update your Chat UI with the messageReceived
    }
  ```
