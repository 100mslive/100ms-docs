Having complete control over your audio/video rooms UI enables you to build customised experiences. With 100ms, our customers can integrate in the following ways: 

- **Customise 100ms Apps** : fork and deploy our feature rich Apps and customise features as per your use cases
    - adding or removing features requires code changes
- **Build You Own UI** : Build entire UI from scratch using 100ms server APIs and client SDKs.

**Pre-requisites to get started**

1. Create your account on [100ms dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/login)
2. Create a Room Template to define your room configuration
    1. 100ms dashboard : go to Templates and set up your first Room Template, here you can configure roles and their permissions. 
    Or
    2. Programatically create with APIs ; Review the [Template object](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/api-reference/policy/template-object) and create a template with [Create Template API](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/api-reference/policy/create-template-via-api) 
3. Rooms on 100ms : A Room gets created by default associated with the template you’ve created. Alternatively, go ahead and create a Room programatically.
    1. Rooms are created on 100ms server and requires your unique [Management Token](https://www.100ms.live/docs/concepts/v2/concepts/security-and-tokens#management-token-for-rest-api) to authenticate all Create Room requests.
    2. Review [Rooms object](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/api-reference/Rooms/object) and create a room with [Create a Room API](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/api-reference/Rooms/create-via-api)
4. Once you have your first Room ready, you can now create room links.

### Create a Room Link for custom UI

Your users need a room link to be able to join a Room, here we discuss creating a room link that looks something like: `your-domain/<room-code>.`  Read more on [Room Codes](/server-side/v2/api-reference/room-codes/room-code-overview).



Sample Code workflow to create Room Links with Room Codes

```python

# template info
template_id = "639cb27a0c77c9782cc50e7b"

# create room 
room_response = create_room(template_id)

# create room code for the above created room
room_codes = create_room_codes(room_response["id"])

# create create room links
room_links = {}
for data in room_codes:
	room_links[data["role"]] = create_room_link(data["code"])

print(room_links)
```

### Authenticating Join Room with Room Codes

You need to authenticate the participants before they Join a Room. Joining a Room requires Authentication Token for each participant. However, you can also use room codes to join a room, while 100ms SDK implicitly handles generating Authentication Token from the room code and allows the peer to join the room

**Implementation**

1. Fetch Room Code : You can fetch the room code in two ways:
    1. Retrieve the room code from the Room Link
    2. Use Get a Room Code API to retrieve the room code
2. You need to then pass the retrieved room code in the join() method in the SDK.

**Other ways to generate Authentication Token**

If you do not wish to use Room Codes, explore other ways:

1. No-code to get started: Get temporary auth tokens from **[the dashboard](https://www.100ms.live/docs/javascript/v2/guides/token#get-a-temporary-token-from-100ms-dashboard)**
2. Use 100ms token server: Use the 100ms **[token endpoint](https://www.100ms.live/docs/javascript/v2/guides/token-endpoint#get-a-token-using-100ms-token-endpoint)** to generate auth tokens, just like our sample apps
3. **[Set up your token server](https://www.100ms.live/docs/concepts/v2/concepts/security-and-tokens#set-up-token-server)**: Recommended approach for production

## Start Building

Once you’ve understood how to create Room Links and handle authentication, let’s start building custom experiences.
