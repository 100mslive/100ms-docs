Embed or share room links without building UI

## Overview

Getting started with 100ms Prebuilt Room Links is the fastest way to test and go live with our ready to use room links. 


**Test a Prebuilt Room Link →**


**Pre-requisites**

1. Create your account on [100ms Dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/login)
2. Create a Room Template to define your room configuration
    1. via 100ms dashboard : Go to Templates and set up your first Room Template, here you can configure roles and their permissions. 
    2. via Create Template API : Review the [Template object](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/api-reference/policy/template-object) and create a template with [Create Template API](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/api-reference/policy/create-template-via-api)
3. Rooms on 100ms : A Room gets created by default associated with the template you’ve created. Alternatively, go ahead and create a Room programatically.
    1. Rooms are created on 100ms server and requires your unique [Management Token](https://www.100ms.live/docs/concepts/v2/concepts/security-and-tokens#management-token-for-rest-api) to authenticate all Create Room requests.
    2. Review [Rooms object](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/api-reference/Rooms/object) and create a room with [Create a Room API](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/api-reference/Rooms/create-via-api)
4. Once you have your first Room ready, you can now go ahead and create and get room links

### **Creating Prebuilt Room Links**

Here we discuss the approaches to get Prebuilt Room links with 100ms dashboard or by creating it yourself. 


The room link that gets generated in each approach is of the format : `https://<template-subdomain>/meeting/<room-code>`

1. **template-subdomain** : this the subdomain that you’ve defined at the time of Template creation. 
2. **Room Code** : Room codes are unique encrypted codes that carry information such as room_id, role and its state. They help you build a Room Link and power the authentication required to join a Room. Read more on Room Codes and its usage [here](https://www.notion.so/Room-Codes-7af2e4413a964e8caf15b2736432f12c).



**100ms Dashboard                                                                                                            No-Code**

1. Go to Rooms page on 100ms dashboard and select a room to go to Rooms details page.
2. On clicking “Join Room”, you can get room links for each role specified in the template

**Create with APIs**

1. With a room is created on 100ms dashboard or with API, you can now construct Prebuilt Room Links with format : `https://<template-subdomain>/meeting/<room-code>`
    1. template-subdomain : Copy this template sub-domain from the 100ms dashboard from the Template Details page.
    2. Room Code : By default, a room code is generated for every role created on a room template.
        1. Get Room Code for an existing role
        2. Get Room Code for all roles in a Room
        3. Create Room Codes : as Room Codes are non-expirable, you can also generate new Room Codes for every new session to generate “fresh Room Links”
    
    Recommended : Review Room Codes and its usage before implementing this.
    
2. Construct your Room Link : Append template-subdomain and Room code to the room link format.

Here is an example pseudo code snippet involving creating a room and then creating room links for that room.
    
    ```python
    # template info
    template_id = "639cb27a0c77c9782cc50e7b"
    template_subdomain = "piyush.app.100ms.live"
    
    # create room 
    room_response = create_room(template_id)
    
    # create room code for the above created room
    room_codes = create_room_codes(room_response["id"])
    
    # create create room links by appending room_code to template_subdomain
    # room_link = https://<template-subdomain>/meeting/<room-code>
    room_links = {}
    for data in room_codes:
    	room_links[data["role"]] = "https://"+template_subdomain+"/meeting/"+data["code"]
    
    print(room_links)
    ```



### **Embed or Share Room Links**

#### Embed room links as iFrame on web, mobile-web

If you want a quick integration of a fully featured video conferencing/live streaming app inside your application within a day, iframe is the way to go.

iframe integration benefits:

- You can have a fully-featured video conferencing/live streaming UI added to your web app with minimal development
- You can customize to a greatest extent as per your requirements
- You can use this in the framework you're already using in your app
- Using an iframe you can embed the whole sample web app inside your UI wherever you want

**Implementation**

Embed the Prebuilt Room Link as an iframe in your application

```jsx
<iframe
    title="100ms-app"
    allow="camera *;microphone *;display-capture *"
    src="<https://<template-subdomain>/meeting/<room-code>>"
    style="height: 900px; width: 900px;">
</iframe>
