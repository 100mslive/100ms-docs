A Room Link is a link that a `peer` can use to Join a Room. It is always associated to a specific Room Id and Role, allowing unique room links for each role in a room.

In order to construct a room link for a role, you need a role specific [room code](/concepts/v2/concepts/rooms/room-codes/room-codes). It is a unique encrypted short code that depicts a unique `room_id` and `role` combination. With 100ms, two types of room links formats are supported: Prebuilt and Custom Domain Room Links.

## Prebuilt Room Links

If you're using 100ms [Prebuilt](/concepts/v2/concepts/prebuilt) solution, the Room Link looks like : `https://<template-subdomain>/meeting/<room-code>`

1. `template-subdomain` : This the subdomain that youâ€™ve defined at the time of Template creation on 100ms dashboard. 
2. `room-code` : This belongs to a unique `room_id` and `role` for which you're creating the Room Link

Head over to [Construct a Prebuilt Room Link](/concepts/v2/concepts/prebuilt#create-prebuilt-room-links) for details.


## Custom Domain Room Links

If you're using 100ms sample apps or building from scratch, you'd need to construct a custom Room Link to share it with your users or embed as an iFrame in your application. A custom domain Room Link looks like `https://<your-domain>/<room-code>`

1. `your-domain` : This allows you to define a customised room link  
2. `room-code` : This belongs to a unique `room_id` and `role` for which you're creating the room link


### Sample Workflow
1. Create a Template, Room and at least one Role
2. Use Create Room Code to generate Room Codes for one or more Roles in a Room
3. Retrieve Room Codes for each Role in the Room.
3. Construct your custom domain Room link using the retrieved Room Code for each role in the Room.

Make sure to use only enabled Room Codes to create Room Links. Read about [Room Code Basics](/concepts/v2/concepts/rooms/room-codes/room-codes#room-codes-basics)
