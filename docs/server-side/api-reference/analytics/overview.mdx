## Analytics APIs

Analytics APIs can be utilized to retrieve events via an HTTP request. By using these APIs, you can retrieve [track events](/server-side/v2/api-reference/analytics/track-events).

Event data can be queried up to last 30 days.

### What can I build?

-   You can use track events to get a better understanding of user activity and build tools around it as explained in [use cases](/server-side/v2/api-reference/analytics/track-events#why-would-you-use-this-api)

<EndpointRequest title="https://api.100ms.live/v2/analytics/events"/>

## Response Object

| Attribute | Description                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `limit`   | Number of events in current response                                                                                                                                             |
| `total`   | Total number of events                                                                                                                                                           |
| `next`    | Used to fetch next set of results, to be specified in the `start` query parameter in subsequent request. Next has non empty value only when there are more events to be queried. |
| `events`  | List of events, refer individual event page for details (Eg: [Track event object](/server-side/v2/api-reference/analytics/track-events#track-event-object))                     |

## Pagination
- Results are paginated with default events count `10`, extendable up to `100` by specifying it in `limit` query parameter.
- If there are more events available then `next` will have a string value. This should be specified in the subsequent call as `start` query parameter to get further events.
- Results are snapshot when query is executed for the first time, newer events (after first query) wonâ€™t appear while iterating results
- Next results will expire after 24 hours from the first query time.
