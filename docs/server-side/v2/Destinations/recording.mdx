## Introduction
SFU recording can be used to save audio/video calls for offline viewing. SFU recording supports both individual and composite recordings.

## Types of SFU recording

### Individual recording
Media for each peer is provided as a seperate mp4 file. This file will have both audio and video of the peer. These files can be used for offline review or in implementating custom composition.

### Composite recording
Audio and video of all peers is composed as per their joining/leaving the meeting and provided as a single mp4. This file can be used for offline viewing of the meeting.

## How to enable SFU recording

### Using Dashboard
There are two ways to enable SFU recording for a room.

#### First way (recommended)
This requires two steps-
1. Provide upload info in the template and enable the SFU recording.

![Enable recording from a template](/docs/v2/recording.png)

2. Choose `Auto` for recording while creating a room.

![Choose auto recording while creating a room](/docs/v2/create-a-room-recording-auto.png)

    > **Note**: Choosing `Auto` for recording will make room's recording settings depends on template.
    >    That means - 
    >   - Enabling/Disabling SFU recording in template will also enable/disable it for the room.
    >   - Changes made in upload settings in template, will also be reflected for the room.

#### Second way
Another way to enable SFU recording for a room is to choose `Enabled` for recording settings while creating it.

![Enable recording when creating a room](/docs/v2/create-a-room-recording-enabled.png)

> **Note**: Choosing `Enabled/Disabled` explicitly for recording while creating a room, will make the recording settings in room not depend on template.
>    That means-
>    - Enabling/Disabling SFU recording in template will have no effect this template.
>    - Room will have its own upload info. By default, they will be uploaded to 100ms storage. More on this below.

### Using API
-   [See detailed API](/server-side/v2/rooms/create-via-api)

### Uploading destination configuration
By default recordings will be uploaded to 100ms storage and a presigned URL for the same will be provided to customers via a webhook. The presigned url will expire in 12hours.
Customers can also configure the recordings to be stored in their cloud storage. Following are the configurations for the same.
