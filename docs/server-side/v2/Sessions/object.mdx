## Overview

Session is a single continuous call in a [room](/server-side/v2/rooms/create-via-api). To allow users to join a 100ms video conferencing session inside your app, you first need to create a room. A single room can have multiple sessions. You will need a [management token](/server-side/v2/introduction/request#authentication-and-tokens) as a bearer token for your requests.

This API retrieves details of a list of sessions in your account. 100ms provides options to

1. retrieve the complete list of sessions or
2. sessions based on the room_id or id or
3. sessions that are active or
4. sessions based on their creation time range or
5. combinations of these.
