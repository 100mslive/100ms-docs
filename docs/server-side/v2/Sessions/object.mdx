## Overview

Session is a single continuous call in a [room](/server-side/v2/rooms/create-via-api). To allow users to join a 100ms video conferencing session inside your app, you first need to create a room. A single room can have multiple sessions. You will need a [management token](/server-side/v2/introduction/request#authentication-and-tokens) as a bearer token for your requests.

This API retrieves details of a list of sessions in your account. 100ms provides actions to

1. retrieve a specific session
2. retrieve a list of sessions based on filters like:
    - status(active/inactive)
    - started timerange
