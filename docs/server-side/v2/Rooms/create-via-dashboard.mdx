## Introduction

Room is a virtual space which holds conferencing of the people. To allow users to join a 100ms video conferencing session inside your app, you first need to create a `room`.

## Create Room using Dashboard

You can create room on [100ms Dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/create-room). While creating a room you can specify it's name, template, region and/or enable SFU recording.

Room creation via dashboard is helpful in doing quick POC or creating smaller number of rooms.
