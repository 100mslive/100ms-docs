## Introduction

Room is a virtual space which holds conferencing of the people. To allow users to join a 100ms video conferencing session inside your app, you first need to create a `room`.

## Create Room via Dashboard

You can create room on [100ms Dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/create-room). While creating a room you can specify it's name, template, region and/or enable SFU recording.

Room creation via dashboard is helpful in doing quick POC or creating smaller number of rooms.

> **Warning:** If you create a room with the name of an existing room, the same room will be updated with the new configuration passed in the request payload. <br/> For example, if the existing room was assigned to template-ABC earlier and in the request payload you've used template-DEF, then template-DEF will be assigned to the existing room.

You can add or modify templates on [100ms Dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/templates).
