## What is a room?

A room is a virtual space where one or more peers communicate with each other. It is a central entity that provides real-time communication capabilities for any video conferencing or live streaming session.

To allow users to join a 100ms video conferencing or a live streaming session inside your app, you first need to create a room.

The above diagram illustrates how a room acts as the central entity in the lifecycle of an interactive audio/video session and the transition of the room from one state to another based on the configuration of the room and the peer's presence.

## Room APIs

Room APIs will enable you to script actions from the server side based on your business logic and requirements, actions such as:

-   [creating a room](/server-side/v2/Rooms/create-via-api),
-   [updating room properties](/server-side/v2/Rooms/update-a-room),
-   [retrieving room details](/server-side/v2/Rooms/retrieve-room), and
-   [disabling/enabling a room](/server-side/v2/Rooms/disable-or-enable).

You can control peer behavior and build interactivity scenarios in an active room with the help of [active room APIs](/server-side/v2/active-rooms/overview).

## Postman collection
