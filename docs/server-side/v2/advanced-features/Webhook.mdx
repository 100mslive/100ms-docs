Webhook is an HTTP(S) endpoint used for pushing the notifications to your application. It will be invoked by 100ms servers to notify events of your room.

# Requirements
Webhook MUST implement `POST` HTTP method for receiving notifications. 100ms notifications are in JSON format so it should be handled accordingly. 

Additionaly, you can specify headers which will be passed transparently to your webhook endpoint. This can be used for securing or tracing the origin of the request.

# How to configure Webhook
Webhook can be configured using [Developer](https://dashboard.100ms.live/developer) section of [100ms Dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/)
