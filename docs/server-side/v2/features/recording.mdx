## Introduction

SFU recording can be used to save audio/video calls for offline viewing. SFU recording supports both individual and composite recordings.

## Types of SFU recording

### Individual recording
Media for each peer is provided as a seperate mp4 file. This file will have both audio and video of the peer. These files can be used for offline review or in implementating custom composition.

### Composite recording
Audio and video of all peers is composed as per their joining/leaving the meeting and provided as a single mp4. This file can be used for offline viewing of the meeting.

### Uploading destination configuration

Customers can also configure the recordings to be stored in their cloud storage. Following are the configurations for the same.
