## Introduction

Recording can be used to save audio/video calls for offline viewing. 100ms supports both individual and composite recordings.

## Types of recording

### Individual recording
Audio and video of each peer is provided as a seperate mp4 file. These files are be used for offline review or in implementating custom composition.

### Composite recording
Audio and video of all peers is composed as per their joining/leaving the meeting and provided as a single mp4. This file can be used for offline viewing of the meeting.

## How to enable recording

### On dashboard

### Uploading destination configuration
By default recordings will be uploaded to 100ms storage and a presigned URL for the same will be provided to customers via a webhook. The presigned url will expire in 12hours.
Customers can also configure the recordings to be stored in thier cloud storage. Following are the configurations for the same.
