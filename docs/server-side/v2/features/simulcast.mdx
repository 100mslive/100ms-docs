## Introduction

Simulcast enables applications to automatically adapt meeting experience across network fluctuations, changes in number of participants, rendering layout changes, etc.


## Usage

When simulcast is enabled, clients will send multiple video streams (or layers) at different quality and bitrate. Receivers can choose the most appropriate stream/layer depending on its bandwidth, display tile size, etc.
This will enable best call experience while considering the network bandwidth and display layout.
