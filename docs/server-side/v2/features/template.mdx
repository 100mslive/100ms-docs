Template is the blueprint of the room. It defines the settings of the room along with the behavior of users who are part of it.

Room will inherit the properties from a template that you have specified while creating it. If you have not specified any template then it will pick the default template.

Each template will be identified by its id. e.g. `default_videoconf_7e450ffc-8ef1-4572-ab28-b32474107b89`

**Note**: As of now templates have only roles section which will be extended in future
