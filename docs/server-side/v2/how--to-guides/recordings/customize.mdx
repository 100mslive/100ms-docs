This guide focuses on customizing room composite (browser-based) recordings.

Composite recordings in 100ms are generated by simulating a peer join: an automated browser window joins the room as bot peer (called "Beam") and records what it sees and hears. Like other peers in the room, this bot peer has an associated [role](../../../../concepts/v2/concepts/templates-and-roles/overview). In this guide, we will create a new role called `recorder`, which will be used by the bot peer to join the room. We will use this role as a way to customize the recording.

We will cover the following customizations:

- Record a specific set of roles
- Change the composition UI: useful when you want to add branding to the recorded output
- Configure the video output: useful to generate a mobile-friendly (portrait) or high resolution output
- Get an audio-only recording

### Define the recorder role

Add a new role called `recorder` to your template. Note that this role:

- Has **no publish strategies**: It does not publish audio, video or screen share
- Has **valid subscribe strategies**: It subscribes to other roles defined in the template

### Use the recorder role

Using the role means that the bot peer joins the room with role set to `recorder`. To do this, we will create a join URL for this role, and pass it as the `meeting_url` in the [start recording API](./overview).

<MeetingUrlConfig />

### Configure who is recorded

The subscribe strategies for the `recorder` role defines which roles are visible to the bot peer, and therefore the roles that are recorded.

For instance, in the example above, above we can limit the subscribe strategies to "host" only (instead of host and guest). That way, only the peers of the host role will be recorded.

### Customize composition UI

Since composite recordings are opening a web browser, they can use full capabilities of HTML/CSS rendering to customize the recorded UI.

Instead of using 100ms links (as shown in step 2 above), we can pass the URL of any web app as `meeting_url`. This URL needs to land in the room directly, without requiring any action on the user's part (for example, to click a join button). The `?skip_preview=true` flag ensures this in the 100ms web app.

### Configure recorded output

We can modify the resolution of the recorded video file. Customizing this does not require adding a new role.

The [start recording API](./overview) accepts optional numeric values for `width` and `height`. If not specified, recording defaults to 1280x720 (16:9).

This can be modified to:

- Have a lower or higher video resolution (for example, `"width": 1920` and `"height": 1080`)
- Have a mobile-first portrait output, which has an aspect ratio of 9:16 (for example, `"width": 720` and `"height": 1280`)

### Get an audio-only recording

The [start recording API](./overview) accepts optional boolean input `audio_only` which can be passed as `true` to get an audio-only composite recording. This would return 1 file with combined audio for all peers in the room.
