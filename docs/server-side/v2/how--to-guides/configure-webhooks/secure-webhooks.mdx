## How to secure webhooks

You can secure webhooks in two ways:

1. Whitelisting 100ms NAT gateway IP addresses,
2. Specifying unique headers while configuring webhook endpoint in 100ms.

### IP whitelisting

Your infrastructure might be secured by a firewall that monitors and filters incoming requests. To ensure that your firewall does not block the event-based webhooks sent by 100ms, allow traffic from these 100ms NAT gateway IP addresses to your webhook endpoint.

```

### Specifying headers

Additionally, you can specify headers that will be passed transparently to your webhook endpoint. This can be used for securing or tracing the origin of the request.
