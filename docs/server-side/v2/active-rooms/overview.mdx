## Overview

Active room APIs allow you to perform various actions on an ongoing session at the room level, such as:

1. [Get the status of a room(whether it's active or not)](/server-side/v2/active-rooms/retrieve-active-room),
2. [Retrieve details of an active room](/server-side/v2/active-rooms/retrieve-active-room),
3. [Retrieve details of a peer](/server-side/v2/active-rooms/retrieve-peer),
4. [Update the details of peers](/server-side/v2/active-rooms/update-a-peer), such as name, role, and metadata(additional/custom information),
5. [Send messages](/server-side/v2/active-rooms/send-message) to a single peer, a set of peers(a particular role), or all connected peers in the active room,
6. [End an active room](/server-side/v2/active-rooms/end-active-room).

This will enable you to script complex actions depending on the use case such as remotely controlling a room and more.
