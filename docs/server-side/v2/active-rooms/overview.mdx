## Overview

You might struggle to understand the difference between rooms and active rooms, we have got it covered for you!
You need to understand two aspects regarding rooms and active rooms:

1. When should I use room APIs and Active room APIs?
2. What's the difference between an active and an inactive room and an enabled and a disabled room?

## When should I use room APIs and Active room APIs?

-   **[Room APIs](/server-side/v2/Rooms/object):** You can use room APIs to create a room, link a template, and update room properties such as recording configuration and server region.
-   **[Active room APIs](/server-side/v2/active-rooms/object):** You can use these APIs to manage an ongoing sessions by performing various actions like managing peers(send messages, update role, etc), build interactivity scenarios(like polls, quizzes, games, etc).

## Room statuses

What's the difference between an active and an inactive room and an enabled and a disabled room?

-   _**Active room**: When at least one or more peers are connected to a room in an ongoing session, then it's called an active room_
-   _**Inactive room**: When no peers are connected to a room to start a session, then it's called an inactive room_
-   _**Enabled room**: A room configuration is updated via dashboard or API to allow peers to join; it's an enabled room._
-   _**Disabled room**: A room configuration is updated via dashboard or API not to allow any peers to join; it's a disabled room._

## Active room APIs

Active room APIs allow you to perform various actions in a room with an ongoing session, such as:

-   [Retrieve an active room](/server-side/v2/active-rooms/retrieve-active-room) to get the list of connected peers at a given time.
-   Manage connected peers by [retrieving specific peer details](/server-side/v2/active-rooms/retrieve-peer) and performing actions such as [updating peers](/server-side/v2/active-rooms/update-a-peer), [sending messages](/server-side/v2/active-rooms/send-message), and [removing peers](/server-side/v2/active-rooms/remove-peers).
-   You can also [end an active room](/server-side/v2/active-rooms/end-active-room).

These APIs will enable you to script complex actions depending on the use case such as remotely controlling a room, building interactivity scenarios and more.
