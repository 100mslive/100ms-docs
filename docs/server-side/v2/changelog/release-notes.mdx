This Changelog highlights notable changes to the 100ms server-side API.

## September 24, 2022.

#### Server update

-   The API is now available in the production environment, using the following base URL:
    `https://api.100ms.live/v2/`

-   **RESTful adherence** - params are now URL params and not query params.

#### Additions

-   A new set of [Room APIs](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/Rooms/object)
-   A new set of [Session APIs](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/Sessions/object)
-   A new set of [Policy APIs](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/policy/template-object)
-   [Destinations object](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/policy/create-template-via-api#destinations-object) is added to the template object.
-   **Virtual controlled Postman collection** -- you can fork our [Postman collection](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/introduction/postman-guide) to stay up to date with the latest API improvements. This will enable you to get familiar with and interact more seamlessly with our product.

#### Improvements

-   **Detailed API reference** -- We have improved our [documentation](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/introduction/basics), so it's easier to get started and stay up to date with the latest API improvements.
-   **Extended pagination for all endpoints** -- We paginate the responses with a list of objects ranging from 10 to 100 to ensure they are easier to handle.

#### Deprecations

-   In the template object, the fields \_id, and customer, supported with the [old API](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/deprecated/templates-and-roles#api-reference), is deprecated. You can continue to use them as id and customer_id with the new API. Refer to the [template object section](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/policy/template-object#template-object) for more information.
-   In the room object, the field template supported with the template name in the [old API](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/deprecated/room#body-paramters) will not be supported in the new API. Instead, you can use the [template_id](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/Rooms/create-via-api#main-arguments) field.

> **Note**: We recommend you use our new API to leverage the new functionalities and features and stay up to date with future releases. <br/> <br/>The old API will remain fully functional until the subsequent notice. Currently, there's no end of life for them; you can continue to check the docs for the old APIs [here](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/deprecated/templates-and-roles).

## October 06, 2022.

#### Additions

-   A new set of [Active room APIs](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/active-rooms/object) enables you to remotely control your active room sessions by performing actions such as [retrieving details of an active session](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/active-rooms/retrieve-active-room-state), [retrieving](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/active-rooms/retrieve-peer)/[updating](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/active-rooms/update-a-peer) peer information, [sending messages](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/active-rooms/send-message), and [ending an active session](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/active-rooms/end-active-room).
-   Added the [API reference documentation](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/deprecated/templates-and-roles#api-reference) for old APIs.

#### Improvements

-   **Simplified generation of management token within Postman collection** -- we've added a pre-request script in our collection to help you generate the management token without creating a token management service at your end for testing. Refer to the [Postman guide](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/introduction/postman-guide#add-management-token) for more details.

#### Deprecations

-   As environment variables created some confusion, we've removed the environment from our Postman collection. We recommend you use the collection variables going forward. Refer to the [Postman guide](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/introduction/postman-guide#add-management-token) for more details.
