## Request

Use the 100ms REST API to interact with 100ms objects (like rooms, sessions, templates) and integrate your backend application with 100ms.

<BaseRequest title="https://api.100ms.live/v2/" />

The REST API uses common HTTP methods:

1. `GET` retrieves data from 100ms server. For example, retrieving details of a specific room
2. `POST` sends new data to 100ms server. For example, creating a room
3. `DELETE` removes existing data from 100ms server. For example, deleting a role from a template

### Headers

| Name          | Value                       | Required |
| :------------ | :-------------------------- | :------- |
| Authorization | Bearer `<management token>` | Yes      |
| Content-type  | application/json            | Yes      |

#### Authorization

Pass the [management token](../../../concepts/v2/concepts/security-and-tokens#management-token-for-rest-api) with your requests for successful authorization.

#### Content-type

The payload for all POST requests should be passed as a JSON object with `Content-Type` header as `application/json`.

## Response

100ms API responds to all requests with a response in JSON format along with an HTTP status code to indicate whether the request was successful.

### Status codes

All requests return one of these standard HTTP status codes

| Code               | Description                                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| 200 - OK           | The request has succeeded                      |
| 204 - No Content   | Resource deleted successfully                  |
| 401 - Unauthorized | No valid API management token provided         |
| 403 - Forbidden    | The API management token provided doesn't have enough permission |
| 404 - Not Found    | The request resource was not found             |
| 500 - Server Error | Something went wrong with 100ms servers        |

### Errors

-   API responses with `4XX` and `5XX` HTTP status codes indicate that the request failed
-   `4XX`: The response body will contain the error message that will help to resolve the error and resend the request

    #### Example:

    ```json
    {
        "code": 401,
        "message": "Token validation error",
        "details": [
            "not found"
        ]
    }
    ```

-   `5XX`: This indicates an error with the 100ms servers, and we work to ensure that these are rare

## Pagination

All API resources support bulk fetches via “list” API methods (for example, list all rooms). These APIs support pagination through query parameters: limit and start.

To fetch the first page of 10 objects, set `limit=10` as a query param. This API will respond with a list of objects in key `data`. The response also has key `last` with the unique identifier for the last object in `data`.

To fetch the second page of 10 objects (11 to 20), pass the previous `last` value as the `start` query param. Set `limit = 10` and `start = <last value from previous response>`.

### List API response structure

| Name  | Type  | Description   |
| ----- | ----- | ------------- |
| limit | `int` | Number of objects the API tried to find. If returned array has lesser number of results, only those number were found |
| data  | `array`  | Array of objects  |
| last  | `string` | Identifier of the last object in the list of objects in the response. Can be used as `start` for subsequent request |

### Params used for pagination

| Name  | Type     | Description                                                                                            |
| ----- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| limit | `int`    | A limit on the number of objects to be returned.<br/> `Default value`: 10<br/> `Allowed range`: 10-100 |
| start | `string` | Determines the starting point in the list of objects to be returned in the response                    |
