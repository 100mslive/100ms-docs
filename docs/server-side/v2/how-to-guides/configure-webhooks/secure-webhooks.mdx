## How to secure webhooks

You can secure webhooks in two ways:

1. Specify secret headers in webhook configuration
1. Whitelisting 100ms IP addresses

## Secret headers

You can specify headers that will be passed transparently to your webhook endpoint. At your end, verify the contents of the HTTP header (key) and value.

Secret headers can be configured on the [100ms dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/developer).

## IP whitelist

For additional security or if your firewall infrastructure can block incoming requests, you can whitelist the following IP addresses. This ensures webhooks that are sent from 100ms-owned NAT gateways are allowed to passthrough.
