This guide will help you create large rooms which support a conferencing or HLS viewer count of up to **20,000** peers. Integration of multiple SFU instances in a mesh configuration, alongside optimized signaling mechanisms, facilitates efficient management of extensive peer lists and related actions like room joining and hand-raising at scale. This scalability enhancement is particularly valuable for webinar and live streaming scenarios in 100ms rooms.

Essentially, two implementation details need attention.

## Create a large room

Standard 100ms rooms handle up to 2500 peers. Large rooms need to be created with special scale optimizations to handle a large number of peers while functioning similarly to standard 100ms rooms. Use 100ms' server-side [Create Room API](/server-side/v2/api-reference/Rooms/create-via-api) to create a room with the `large_room` flag enabled. Use the `size` field to define the maximum number of expected peers in that room.
The following cURL example illustrates how to create a large room.

<PostRequest title="https://api.100ms.live/v2/rooms" />
<Request id="req-comp-0">
```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.100ms.live/v2/rooms' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <management_token>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "name": "new-large-room-081023",
    "description": "This is a sample description for the room",
    "template_id": "<template_id of the template you wish to associate with the room>",
    "large_room": true,
    "size":20000
}'
```
</Request>
<ResponseBox id="resp-0" status="200 OK">

```json
{
    "id": "631b2654f771854d9bf633df",
    "name": "new-large-room-081023",
    "enabled": true,
    "description": "This is a sample description for the room",
    "customer_id": "627cdddff2e4e30487862ad1",

}
```

</ResponseBox>

When using the above API, following points need to be noted:

1. The range of values for `size` can go up to 20,000 when the `large_room` flag is enabled. Expect the following error if a value larger than 20,000 is used.

```json
{
    "code": 400,
    "message": "Invalid body param",
    "details": ["Invalid body param: room size greater than 20000"]
}
```

2. All rooms which require the `size` to be greater than 2500 need to have the `large_room` flag enabled. Expect the following error if a value larger than 2500 is used without enabling the flag.

```json
{
    "code": 400,
    "message": "Invalid body param",
    "details": ["Invalid body param: room size greater than 2500, set large_room flag as true"]
}
```

3. The client side SDK optimisations only kick in if the `large_room` flag is enabled. Additionally, large rooms cannot be created through the 100ms dashboard yet.

> **Note**
>
> -   Large rooms support only 200 publishing peers. Publishing peers are defined as peers with audio and video publishing permissions.
> -   Large rooms support a maximum of 200 hand-raises at a single point of time.

## Client-side implementation

In order to take advantage of these large rooms, you are required to use platform SDKs whose versions are higher than or equal to:

1. For Web - `@100mslive/hms-video-store v0.10.17` and `@100mslive/react-sdk v0.8.17`
2. For Android - `@live.100ms/android-sdk v2.7.7`
3. For iOS - `v1.1.0`
4. For React Native - `@100mslive/react-native-hms v2.0.0-alpha.0`

### Handling peer hand-raise function

100ms now supports first class APIs for hand-raise functionality. The following can be accomplished using them:

-   How to raise and lower hand
-   How to lower hand of a remote peer
-   How to know when a peer raises or lowers their hand

Follow the given documentation to implement the above functionalities.

-   On [Web](/javascript/v2/how-to-guides/build-interactive-features/handraise)
-   On [Android](/android/v2/how-to-guides/interact-with-room/peer/large-room)
-   On [iOS](/ios/v2/how-to-guides/interact-with-room/peer/large-room)
-   On [React Native](/react-native/v2/how-to-guides/interact-with-room/peer/large-room)
-   On [Flutter](/flutter/v2/how-to-guides/interact-with-room/peer/large-room#handle-raise-and-lower-hand)

### Working with the peer list

If the room is very large, it is difficult to fetch each and every peer. To get the **list of peers** or the **peer count** of the room, use the following documentation:

-   On [Web](/javascript/v2/how-to-guides/set-up-video-conferencing/peerlist-optimizations)
-   On [Android](/android/v2/how-to-guides/interact-with-room/peer/large-room#how-to-get-total-peer-count-of-the-room)
-   On [iOS](/ios/v2/how-to-guides/interact-with-room/peer/large-room#how-to-get-peer-list-iterator-in-a-large-room)
-   On [React Native](/react-native/v2/how-to-guides/interact-with-room/peer/large-room#how-to-get-total-peer-count-of-the-room)
-   On [Flutter](/flutter/v2/how-to-guides/interact-with-room/peer/large-room#how-to-get-total-peer-count-of-the-room)

> **Note**
>
> There will be no changes in functionality of the APIs shared above, if `large_room` flag is not enabled.
