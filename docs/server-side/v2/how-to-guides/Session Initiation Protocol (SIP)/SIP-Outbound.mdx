## Overview

<Note type='warning'>
This feature is in *restricted access*. Please drop a message to us through the Support center on the 100ms dashboard or book a [meeting with us](https://www.100ms.live/contact) to get your account whitelisted for SIP.
</Note>

100ms’ SIP bridge allows you to bridge participants on SIP calls by using a third-party service (like Twilio, Telnyx) into your 100ms room. 

A SIP outbound trunk enables customers to set up credentials for outbound communication from 100ms room.

This documentation details the steps to create and update a SIP outbound trunk for outbound communication, as well as to initiate an outbound call. It includes API endpoints and sample JSON payloads for these procedures.

## Create an outbound trunk - Provision 100ms room for SIP dial-out

This API allows you to set up a dedicated trunk and generate a `trunk_id` which is required before initiating an outbound call from a 100ms room. 

Most SIP trunks provide a `username` and `password` for authentication along with a SIP address. Additionally, you are also required to purchase a phone number from the PSTN to the SIP service provider. For our example requests and tests, we’ve used Twilio.

### **Request**

**API Endpoint**

**POST** `https://api.100ms.live/v2/sip/outbound/trunks`

```json
//Request Body
{
    "username": "<USERNAME>",
    "password": "<PASSWORD>",
    "address": "<trunk-name>.pstn.twilio.com", // Twilio has been used as an example. This could be any SIP trunk provider's address.
    "from": "+971667*****"
}
```

**Request arguments**

| Arguments   | Description                                                            |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `username`  | SIP Credentials shared by the SIP Trunk service provider               |
| `password`  | SIP Credentials shared by the SIP Trunk service provider               |
| `address`   | This is the SIP address of the SIP Trunk service provider.             |
| `from`      | This is the phone number acquired from the SIP Trunk service provider. |

These credentials are used for authentication when bridging the call between the SIP Trunk and 100ms' SIP bridge. They are usually provided by all major service providers. For Twilio, follow these steps:

1. Create an account on Twilio.
2. Get a phone number. Refer [this](https://help.twilio.com/articles/223135247-How-to-Search-for-and-Buy-a-Twilio-Phone-Number-from-Console).
3. Create a [SIP Credential Resource](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/sip/api/sip-credential-resource) - `username` and `password`. 
4. Get the address → [Twilio Documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/api/sending-sip)

## Initiating an outbound call

This API initiates a SIP call from a 100ms room to an external peer.

The API will be blocked and will not share a response until the caller has either received or denied the call. In case, you want to initiate another call from the same trunk, the API can be called again.

### Request
