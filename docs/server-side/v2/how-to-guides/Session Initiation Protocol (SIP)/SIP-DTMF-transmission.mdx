title: DTMF Transmission via SIP
nav: 10.2
---

This documentation describes how to transmit Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) signaling through the SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) interface using 100ms' REST API. DTMF tones are used for telecommunication signaling over the line in voice-frequency bands to the call control.

## Overview

The DTMF API provided by 100ms enables the transmission of DTMF tones directly to SIP participants during a call. This capability is essential for interacting with voice response systems, navigating phone trees or for controlling aspects of a session that require numeric input.

## Points on Server-Side DTMF Generation

1. **Simplified Client Logic:** Offloading DTMF generation to the server reduces complexity on client devices (iOS, Android, Web), which don't need to implement DTMF logic.
2. **Data Integrity:** Keeping data in digital form until necessary minimizes the risk of data loss due to packet loss, which can occur when converting digital signals to analog prematurely.
3. **Selective Transmission:** Ensures that DTMF tones are only sent to SIP connections, avoiding unnecessary transmission to non-SIP participants.
4. **Vendor Limitations:** Not all service providers support server-side DTMF transmission. This could limit flexibility if switching providers or integrating with other systems. However, this is mitigated by 100ms providing a simple client-side implementation for generating DTMF.

## REST API Endpoint for DTMF Transmission

**Host:** `https://sip.100ms.live/dtmf`

**Method:** `POST`

**Headers:**

- `Authorization: Bearer <AUTH TOKEN>` -> Client Auth Tokens are required to access this API; Management Tokens are not compatible for this API. For instructions on generating an auth token, please refer to this [documentation](/get-started/v2/get-started/security-and-tokens#auth-token-for-client-sdks).
- `Content-Type: application/json`

**Request Body Example:**

```json
{
  "digits": ["0", "1"]  // Array of DTMF digits
}
```

**Request Parameters Description:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| digits | array | An array of strings, where each string is a character representing a DTMF tone. Valid characters are 0-9, *, #, a, b, c, d. |

- **Target Recipients:** The DTMF tones will only be sent to all SIP participants present in the call. WebRTC participants will not receive these tones.
- **Transmission Order:** Requests are queued and processed sequentially; subsequent requests will not be processed until all previous tones have been sent.
- **Timing:** Tones are transmitted at an interval of 100 milliseconds and last for 100 milliseconds. This timing is consistent across all requests.

## Responses

**200 OK**

Indicates successful request processing. The body will be empty as the focus is on the action performed rather than data returned.

```json
{}

```

**400 Bad Request**

Occurs when there are no SIP participants in the call to receive the DTMF tones.

```json
{
  "code": 400,
  "message": "no sip participants in the call",
  "details": [""]
}

```


This documentation provides a clear pathway for integrating DTMF transmission capabilities within your applications, ensuring effective interaction with systems requiring numerical input during SIP calls.
