You can refer to our [Live Streaming API documentation](/server-side/v2/api-reference/live-streams/start-live-stream-for-room) to start recording.

1. You are required to mark the transcription `enabled` flag in the request as `true` and select `live` in `modes`to transcribe unless you’ve already enabled transcription for the given room template. Refer Dashboard.
2. You can override the live transcription settings given in the template when starting the live stream through the Live Stream API.
3. If no input is given, the API will pick up the transcription configuration from the template policy / configuration.

#### Advanced Configuration

There are two advanced configuration that are currently offered.

1. **Custom Vocabulary**: Add non-dictionary words like names, abbreviations, slang, and technical jargon which may not be recognised by the AI model for better transcription accuracy.
2. **Language:** Select the language that needs to be transcribed. This will be the spoken language and not for the purpose of translation. Transcription only supports **English** language at this point of time. Support for more languages will come soon.

### Consumption

#### Prebuilt
Our Prebuilt player on web supports HLS with live transcription out of the box. It allows the functionality of enabling and disabling this feature using the CC button on the player.

<video loop="true" autoplay="autoPlay" controls="false" id="vid" muted>
    <source src="/docs/docs/v2/cc-on-hls-player-web.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

Learn more about live streaming [here](/get-started/v2/get-started/features/live-streaming) and get started with integrating Prebuilt using [this](/get-started/v2/get-started/prebuilt/overview).

#### Within your player

The transcript `.vtt` files are delivered as part of the HLS manifest itself. If a HLS compatible player is used, it should support closed captioning by default.

All that is required is to input the URL to `master.m3u8` into a compatible HLS player.

The functionality of turning live transcription on / off on the player itself for the user is something that might have to be built by you.
