Analytics Events APIs are used to fetch events with an HTTP request. Currently, we support retrieving [track](/server-side/v2/api-reference/analytics-events/track-events)
and [recording](/server-side/v2/api-reference/analytics-events/recording-events) events.

Event data is queryable for upto last 30 days.

| --------- |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `limit`   | Number of events in the response                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `total`   | Total number of events present                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `next`    | Used to fetch next set of results, to be specified in the `start` query parameter. Present only when there are more events present. Next set of results will expire after 24 hours from query time.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `events`  | List of events, refer individual event page for details (Eg: [Track event object](/server-side/v2/api-reference/analytics-events/track-events#track-object))                                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Pagination
- Results are paginated with default events count `10`, which is extendable upto `100` by specifying it in `limit` query parameter.
- If there are more events available than limit then `next` will have string value. This should be specified in the subsequent call as `start` query parameter to get further events.
- Results are snapshot when query is executed for the first time, newer events (after first query) wonâ€™t appear while iterating next results
- Next set of results will expire after 24 hours from the query time (Results won't be queryable by specifying `start`)
