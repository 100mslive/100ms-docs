## Analytics APIs

Analytics APIs can be utilized to retrieve events via an HTTP request. By using these APIs, you can retrieve the following supported events mentioned in the next section.

### Supported Events

-  [Track Events](/server-side/v2/api-reference/analytics/track-events)
    - `track.add.success`
    - `track.update.success`
    - `track.remove.success`

-  [Recording Events](/server-side/v2/api-reference/analytics/recording-events)
    - `beam.recording.success`

-  [Error Events](/server-side/v2/api-reference/analytics/error-events)
    - `client.publish.failed`
    - `client.subscribe.failed`
    - `client.join.failed`
    - `client.disconnected`
    - `client.connect.failed`

Event data can be queried up to **last 30 days**.

### What can I build?

-   You can use track events to get a better understanding of user activity and build tools around it as explained in [use cases](/server-side/v2/api-reference/analytics/track-events#why-would-you-use-this-api)
-   You can use error events to dig deeper into the issues which your users are facing.

## Pagination
- Results are paginated with default events count `10`, extendable up to `100` by specifying it in `limit` query parameter.
- If there are more events available then `next` will have a string value. This should be specified in the subsequent call as `start` query parameter to get further events.
- Results are snapshot when query is executed for the first time, newer events (after first query) wonâ€™t appear while iterating results
- Next results will expire after 24 hours from the first query time.
