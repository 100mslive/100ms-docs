## Analytics APIs

Analytics APIs can be utilized to retrieve events via an HTTP request. By using these APIs, you can retrieve the following supported events mentioned in the next section.

### Supported Events

-  [Track Events](/server-side/v2/api-reference/analytics/track-events)
    - `track.add.success`
    - `track.update.success`
    - `track.remove.success`

-  [Recording Events](/server-side/v2/api-reference/analytics/recording-events)
    - `beam.recording.success`

-  [Error Events](/server-side/v2/api-reference/analytics/error-events)
    - `client.publish.failed`
    - `client.subscribe.failed`
    - `client.join.failed`
    - `client.disconnected`
    - `client.connect.failed`

-  [List Webhook Events](/server-side/v2/api-reference/analytics/list-webhook-events)
    - Retrieve webhook delivery history

-  [Replay Webhook Events](/server-side/v2/api-reference/analytics/replay-webhook-events)
    - Replay failed or successful webhooks

-  [Peer Quality Stats](/server-side/v2/api-reference/analytics/peer-quality-stats)
    - Time-series quality metrics (bitrate, packet loss, FPS, RTT) for a peer in a session

Event data can be queried up to **last 30 days**.

### What can I build?

-   You can use track events to get a better understanding of user activity and build tools around it as explained in [use cases](/server-side/v2/api-reference/analytics/track-events#why-would-you-use-this-api)
-   You can use error events to dig deeper into the issues which your users are facing.
-   You can use webhook events to monitor webhook delivery health and replay failed webhooks after recovering from downtime.
-   You can use peer quality stats to debug call quality issues, monitor network conditions, and build custom quality dashboards.

## Pagination
- Results are paginated with default events count `10`, extendable up to `100` by specifying it in `limit` query parameter.
- If there are more events available then `next` will have a string value. This should be specified in the subsequent call as `start` query parameter to get further events.
- Results are snapshot when query is executed for the first time, newer events (after first query) won’t appear while iterating results
- Next results will expire after 24 hours from the first query time.
