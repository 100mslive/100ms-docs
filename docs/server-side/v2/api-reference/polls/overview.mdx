The Poll API on the server side allows you to create, manage, and participate in polls and quizzes. Polls are an effective way to gather opinions, feedback, and insights from a group of people in a quick and convenient manner. With the Polls APIs you can create polls and gather information about polls sessions, results and responses.

This feature can also be used to create quizzes. Under the hood, quizzes are like polls where questions have right or wrong answers.

This document provides guidance on how to use the Poll APIs to create a poll, update polls, fetch results, responses and sessions.

Polls and quizzes can be created/updated using these APIs. 
A recommended way to create a poll is to provide a list of questions while [creating poll](/server-side/v2/api-reference/polls/create-polls-via-api), then update those questions by modifying them using update question/delete question or update/delete opions API. 

To fetch results/responses use get results/result and response/responses APIs. 

To enable auto start of polls and to [import/link](/server-side/v2/api-reference/polls/link-polls-with-room-via-api) polls in a room, use rooms update/create api with polls field.
