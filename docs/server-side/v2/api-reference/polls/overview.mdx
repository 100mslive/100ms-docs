Polls and quizzes can be created/updated using these APIs. A recommended way to create a poll is to provide a list of questions while creating poll, then update those questions by modifying them using update/delete question/option API. To fetch results/responses use get results/result and response/responses APIs. 

To enable auto start of polls and to import/link polls in a room, use rooms update api with polls field.
