title: Pause recording for stream
nav: 3.167
---

Use this API to pause recording that is running for the live stream.

In situations when the broadcaster gets disconnected or leaves the room, it is useful to pause recordings. When the broadcaster is back, the recording can be [resumed](./resume-live-stream-recording). This ensures that the recording is fit for video on-demand playback.
