100ms rooms can be live streamed over HLS (HTTP Live Streaming). 100ms live streams return a playback URL (in m3u8 format), which is compatible with any HLS video player.

Live streams can be optionally recordedâ€”and generate two types of [recording assets](../recording-assets/overview), based on enabled flags:

* `hls_vod`: Setting this to true generates a `room-vod` asset for on-demand playback use-cases
* `single_file_per_layer`: Setting this to true generates multiple `room-composite` assets, each representing 1 layer of the live stream
