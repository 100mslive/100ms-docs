Use this request to list and filter through recording jobs of a workspace. The response is paginated.

This list can be filtered by `room_id`, `session_id` or `status` to find the relevant recording object for a room or session.

## Recording assets

> Note: This API does not return the list of [recording assets](../recording-assets/overview) to optimize for performance. To fetch the list of assets for a recording job, use the [get recording API](./get-recording).

A common scenario is to fetch the recording assets for a room or session. To do so, use the [list recording assets API](../recording-assets/list-all-assets), and pass the `room_id` or `session_id` query parameter to filter the response.
