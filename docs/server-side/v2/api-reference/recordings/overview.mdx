This object refers to recording jobs that are running in 100ms rooms. With these REST APIs, you can start a new recording job, fetch a recording job (which could have been started from a client SDK) and stop recording jobs.

These jobs (called recordings) generate assets (called [recording assets](../recording-assets/overview)).

![Recordings generate recording assets](/docs/v2/recording-vs-assets.png)

Currently the following asset types are supported

* `room-composite`
* `chat`
* `transcript`
* `summary`
