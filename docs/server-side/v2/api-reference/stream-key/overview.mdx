This object refers to RTMP stream key needed for ingesting media from a RTMP broadcaster. With these REST APIs, you can create a RTMP stream key for a specific room, get an active stream key for a specific room, or disable an existing active stream key for a specific room. Additionally, the APIs also return `url` which contains the RTMP URL.

Use stream key and RTMP URL to ingest RTMP-encoded media from a broadcasting software (for example - OBS Studio) and play it in a 100ms room as a HLS stream.

| enabled     | Property of type `boolean` which tells whether the stream key is active or not                                   |
| created_at  | Timestamp when the stream key was created (in ISO-8601 format)                                                   |
| updated_at  | Timestamp for when the status of the key was updated (in ISO-8601 format)                                        |                                                                               

> **Note**
> 
> RTMP stream key should be kept private. In case the key gets leaked publicly, we highly recommend resetting it using the method shared in the [Disable Stream Key API documentation](/server-side/v2/api-reference/stream-key/disable-rtmp-stream-key).
