Recording assets are files that are generated after a successful recording. Recording assets are also generated through [live streams](../live-streams/overview) and [external streams](../external-streams/overview) when recording is enabled.

If a cloud storage location (AWS S3 or GCS) is configured on the template, the recording asset is uploaded to the defined location. Else, it is uploaded on 100ms storage buckets. These recordings can be downloaded by [generating short-live pre-signed URLs](./get-presigned-url).

## Asset types

* `room-composite`: This type composes a single video (mp4) out of all peers in the room.
* `room-vod`: This is also a composition of all peers in the room and is available in HLS (or m3u8) format for on-demand playback.
