Recording assets are files that are generated after a successful [recording](../recordings/overview). Recording assets are also generated through [live streams](../live-streams/overview) and [external streams](../external-streams/overview) when recording is enabled.

If a cloud storage location (for example, AWS S3 or GCS) is configured on the template, we upload the recording asset to the defined location. Else, the asset is uploaded to 100ms storage buckets. These recordings can be downloaded by [generating short-live pre-signed URLs](./get-presigned-url) before the retention period of 15 days.

## Asset types

* `room-composite`: This type composes a single video (mp4) out of all peers in the room.
* `room-vod`: This is also a composition of all peers in the room and is available in HLS (or m3u8) format for on-demand playback.
* `chat`: This type captures chat messages that were exchanged while recording was running.
* `transcript`: This type is composed of generated transcripts of the recording, if transcription was enabled. The `metadata` will contain the `output_mode` (`txt`, `srt`, `json`).
* `summary`: This type contains the summary generated from the transcript. The `metadata` will contain the `output_mode` (`json`).
