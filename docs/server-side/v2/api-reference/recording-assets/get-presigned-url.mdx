Use this API to generate a short-lived pre-signed URL for a recording asset.

By default, the generated URL has an expiry of 3 days for AWS S3 and GCS buckets and 9 hours for Alibaba OSS storage. You can pass a `?presign_duration=number` query param to control the validity of the URL.

> **Note on `url` in the API response**

> In the case of `room-vod` asset type, the `url` can contain 3 things depending on the configured storage and VOD upload format. It will contain:
> - Pre-signed URL to let you download the zipped VOD file if the VOD upload format is 'zipped', irrespective of the configured storage.
> - CDN URL which can be put in any HLS compatible player to play the VOD file if the configured storage is 100ms' and the VOD upload format in 'Unzipped'.
> - Pre-signed URL to the M3U8 file which is not playable if the configured recording storage is the user's cloud bucket and the VOD upload format is 'Unzipped'.
