## When does a room become active?

A room becomes active when one or more peers join a room to start real-time video/audio interactions in a video conferencing or live streaming session.

## Active room APIs

Use Active Room APIs to perform server-to-server actions that automate your business logic in 100ms rooms. These actions can be used to control peer behavior and build interactivity scenarios

-   Control peers by [changing roles](/server-side/v2/active-rooms/update-a-peer), [removing peers](/server-side/v2/active-rooms/remove-peers), and [ending the room](/server-side/v2/active-rooms/end-active-room)
-   Build interactivity scenarios by [updating peer metadata](/server-side/v2/active-rooms/update-a-peer) and [sending broadcast/direct messages](/server-side/v2/active-rooms/send-message)
-   [Retrieving the details of an active room](/server-side/v2/active-rooms/retrieve-active-room) and [a specific peer](/server-side/v2/active-rooms/retrieve-peer) will act as supporting pillars to implement the above mentioned actions.

### When should I use room APIs and Active room APIs?

-   **Room APIs**: You can use room APIs to create a room, link a template, and update room properties such as recording configuration and server region.
-   **Active room APIs**: You can use these APIs to control peer behavior and build interactivity scenarios in an active room.

### What can I build?

We have drafted some examples to help you understand how active room APIs will enable you to control peer behavior and build interactivity scenarios:

-   [Fetch the list of peers](/server-side/v2/active-rooms/retrieve-active-room) in an active room and perform actions like:
    -   Nudge a specific peer if their [video is turned off](/server-side/v2/active-rooms/retrieve-peer#why-would-you-use-this-api).
    -   Send a broadcast message to all peers to inform the speaker's unavailability. For [example](/server-side/v2/active-rooms/send-message#why-would-you-use-this-api), send a message to all the students if the teacher cannot join the session at the last minute.
    -   [Kick a peer](/server-side/v2/active-rooms/remove-peers#why-would-you-use-this-api) in case of any misconduct(abusive chat).
-   To build real-time interactivity, like [updating a custom avatar](/server-side/v2/active-rooms/update-a-peer#why-would-you-use-this-api) in the video tile, [virtual poker handler](/server-side/v2/active-rooms/send-message#example2-poker-handler) for a multiplayer game, and more.
