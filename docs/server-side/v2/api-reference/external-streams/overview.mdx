100ms rooms can be live streamed to external platforms that support RTMP-in (for example, YouTube, Twitch). These live streams are called **external streams**. An external stream maps to up to 3 RTMP URLs.

External streams can be optionally recorded by passing a boolean flag. This generates a `room-composite` [recording asset](../recording-assets/overview) at the end of the external stream.
