## API Overview

Create rooms, configure and maintain room policies and templates, start recording or RTMP streaming, and access events via 100ms' APIs. These APIs use standard HTTP verbs and HTTP status codes to make it simple to incorporate video into your code. We serve our API through HTTPS to secure your requests to our servers.
