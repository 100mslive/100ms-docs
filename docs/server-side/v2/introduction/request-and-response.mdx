## Request

Our REST APIs enable you to access various capabilities to complete your integration based on the requirements for your use case.

<BaseRequest title="https://api.100ms.live/v2/" />

You can leverage these requests using the common HTTP methods:

1. **GET** - retrieves data from 100ms server. **Example**: Retrieve details of a specific room
2. **POST** - sends new data to 100ms server. **Example**: Create a room
3. **DELETE** - removes existing data from 100ms server. **Example**: Delete a role from a template.

### Content type

The input of the request should be of the type application/json. The payload for all POST requests should be passed as a JSON object with the Content-Type as `application/json.

Most of the GET request arguments must be passed as a path param whereas some of the APIs accept it as a query param.

DELETE request arguments should be passed as a path param.

#### Headers

| Name                | Value                       | Required |
| :------------------ | :-------------------------- | :------- |
| Content-type <br/>  | application/json            | Yes      |
| Authorization <br/> | Bearer `<management token>` | Yes      |

## Pagination

All the API resources have support for bulk fetches via “list” API methods. For instance, list all rooms, list all sessions, and list all templates. These list APIs share a common structure, taking at least three parameters: limit, start, and last. You can use these parameters to easily traverse all pages of a list.

For instance, if a search request has a result of 20 objects with `limit = 10` and `start = <last objectID from result of the previous request>`, then objects with indices 11 through 20 are returned.

### Params used for pagination

| Name  | Type     | Description                                                                                            |
| :---- | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| limit | `int`    | A limit on the number of objects to be returned.<br/> `Default value`: 10<br/> `Allowed range`: 1-20   |
| start | `object` | Determines the starting point in the list of objects to be returned in the response.                   |
| last  | `object` | The last object in the list of objects in the response. Can be used as `start` for subsequent request. |

## Response

100ms API responds to all requests with a response in JSON format along with an HTTP status code to indicate whether the request was successful.

### HTTP status codes

All requests return one of these standard HTTP status codes

| Code               | Description                                                       |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 200 - OK           | The request has succeeded.                                        |
| 204 - No Content   | Resource deleted.                                                 |
| 401 - Unauthorized | No valid API management token provided.                           |
| 403 - Forbidden    | The API management token provided doesn't have enough permission. |
| 404 - Not Found    | The request resource was not found.                               |
| 500 - Server Error | Something went wrong with 100ms servers. (These are rare).        |

### Errors

-   API responses with `4XX` and `5XX HTTP status codes` indicate that the request has failed.
-   `4XX`: This can be either 401 or 403 or 404. You can refer to the [status codes section](#http-status-codes) for more information. Also, the response body will contain the error message that will help to resolve the error and resend the request.

    **Example**:

    ```json
    {
        "code": 404,
        "message": "Error: Room not found",
        "data": {
            "description": "Error: Room not found"
        }
    }
    ```

-   `5XX`: Server errors. This happens when something is wrong with 100ms servers(these are rare).
