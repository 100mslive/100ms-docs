## Request

Our REST APIs enable you to access various capabilities to complete your integration based on the requirements for your use case.

<BaseRequest title="https://api.100ms.live/v2/" />

You can leverage these requests using the common HTTP methods:

1. **GET** - retrieves data from 100ms server. **Example**: Retrieve details of a specific room
2. **POST** - sends new data to 100ms server. **Example**: Create a room
3. **DELETE** - removes existing data from 100ms server. **Example**: Delete a role from a template.

### Content type

The input of the request should be of the type application/json. The payload for all POST requests should be passed as a JSON object with the Content-Type as `application/json`.

Most of the GET request arguments must be passed as a path param whereas some of the APIs accept it as a query param.

DELETE request arguments should be passed as a path param.

#### Headers

| Name                | Value                       | Required |
| :------------------ | :-------------------------- | :------- |
| Content-type <br/>  | application/json            | Yes      |
| Authorization <br/> | Bearer `<management token>` | Yes      |

## Response

100ms API responds to all requests with a response in JSON format along with an HTTP status code to indicate whether the request was successful.

### HTTP status codes

All requests return one of these standard HTTP status codes

| Code               | Description                                                       |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 200 - OK           | The request has succeeded.                                        |
| 204 - No Content   | Resource deleted.                                                 |
| 401 - Unauthorized | No valid API management token provided.                           |
| 403 - Forbidden    | The API management token provided doesn't have enough permission. |
| 404 - Not Found    | The request resource was not found.                               |
| 500 - Server Error | Something went wrong with 100ms servers. (These are rare).        |

### Errors

-   API responses with `4XX` and `5XX HTTP status codes` indicate that the request has failed.
-   `4XX`: This can be either 401 or 403 or 404. You can refer to the [status codes section](#http-status-codes) for more information. Also, the response body will contain the error message that will help to resolve the error and resend the request.

    #### Example:

    ```json
    {
        "code": 404,
        "message": "Error: Room not found",
        "data": {
            "description": "Error: Room not found"
        }
    }
    ```

-   `5XX`: Server errors. This happens when something is wrong with 100ms servers(these are rare).

## Pagination

All API resources support bulk fetches via “list” API methods (e.g. list all rooms). These APIs use query parameters - limit, start, and last - to support pagination.

To fetch the first page of 10 objects, set `limit=10` as a query param. This API will respond with a list of objects in key `data`. The response also has key `last` with the unique identifier for the last object in `data`.

To fetch the second page of 10 objects (11 to 20), pass the previous `last` value as the `start` query param. Set `limit = 10` and `start = &lt;last value from previous response&gt;`.

### List API response variables

| Name        | Type       | Description                                                                                                            |
| :---------- | :--------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| limit <br/> | `int`      | Number of objects the API tried to find. If returned array has lesser number of results, only those number were found. |
| data <br/>  | `array`    | Array of objects.                                                                                                      |
| last <br/>  | `ObjectID` | The last object in the list of objects in the response. Can be used as `start` for subsequent request.                 |

### Params used for pagination

| Name  | Type     | Description                                                                                          |
| :---- | :------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| limit | `int`    | A limit on the number of objects to be returned.<br/> `Default value`: 10<br/> `Allowed range`: 1-20 |
| start | `object` | Determines the starting point in the list of objects to be returned in the response.                 |
