100ms collection includes API for our video components like rooms, sessions, policies, etc that are packaged and ready to use with Postman, along with documentation for each API to help you learn about them. You can import/fork these APIs and start using them instantly. The API collection comes with predefined environment variables to help you get started immediately.

## Fork the collection

[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://god.gw.postman.com/run-collection/22726679-47dcd974-29d5-4965-a35b-bf9b74a8b25a?action=collection%2Ffork&collection-url=entityId%3D22726679-47dcd974-29d5-4965-a35b-bf9b74a8b25a%26entityType%3Dcollection%26workspaceId%3Dd9145dd6-337b-4761-81d6-21a30b4147a2#?env%5B100ms%20API%20Environment%5D=W3sia2V5IjoiSE9TVCIsInZhbHVlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9hcGkuMTAwbXMubGl2ZS92Mi8iLCJlbmFibGVkIjp0cnVlLCJ0eXBlIjoiZGVmYXVsdCIsInNlc3Npb25WYWx1ZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXBpLjEwMG1zLmxpdmUvdjIvIiwic2Vzc2lvbkluZGV4IjowfSx7ImtleSI6IlRPS0VOIiwidmFsdWUiOiI8WU9VUl9NQU5BR0VNRU5UX1RPS0VOPiIsImVuYWJsZWQiOnRydWUsInR5cGUiOiJkZWZhdWx0Iiwic2Vzc2lvblZhbHVlIjoiPFlPVVJfTUFOQUdFTUVOVF9UT0tFTj4iLCJzZXNzaW9uSW5kZXgiOjF9XQ==)

You can click on this button to fork the 100ms API collection.

## Add management token

100ms uses management tokens to authenticate REST APIs. To create the management token, you must use the `app_access_key` and `app_secret` from the developer section in your 100ms dashboard. Refer to the [authentication and tokens guide](https://100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/introduction/authentication-and-tokens#code-sample-generate-management-token) for more information on generating the management token.
Once you have generated the management token you can use the same as an `collection variable` in the forked Postman collection.

To use collection variables -- Go to **Collections > 100ms API** and replace the placeholder `<YOUR_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN>` with the management token generated as instructed above and save the changes.

Once you have done that, you can access your Token by writing {{TOKEN}} within your Postman collection. We have already done that for you for all the APIs in the 100ms collection.

> Note: If you prefer, you can configure these as `Environment variables`. 

## Example: Create a room

Let's try to create a room to see how the 100ms collection works. From the forked REST API collection, select the folder named **Room APIs **and select the request to `create room`. Replace the placeholders like name, description, template_id, etc with the desired values. Click the `Send` button once done.

## API Reference

You can refer to the detailed[ API reference](/server-side/v2/Rooms/object) to understand the request/response structure better, request arguments, response variables, webhooks, etc.

## Stay up to date

Similar to how the forked repository on GitHub works, you can stay up to date with the 100ms master collection by [pulling the changes](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/version-control/#pulling-updates).
