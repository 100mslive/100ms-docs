100ms collection includes API for rooms, sessions, policies, etc., packaged and ready to use with Postman, along with documentation for each API to help you learn about them. You can import/fork these APIs and start using them instantly.

The API collection comes with predefined collection variables and a pre-request script that generates the management token to help you get started immediately.

## Fork the collection

[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://god.gw.postman.com/run-collection/22726679-47dcd974-29d5-4965-a35b-bf9b74a8b25a?action=collection%2Ffork&collection-url=entityId%3D22726679-47dcd974-29d5-4965-a35b-bf9b74a8b25a%26entityType%3Dcollection%26workspaceId%3Dd9145dd6-337b-4761-81d6-21a30b4147a2)

You can click on this button to fork the 100ms API collection.

## Authentication

100ms uses management tokens to authenticate REST APIs. To create the management token, you must use the `App Access Key` and `App Secret` from the [developer section](https://dashboard.100ms.live/developer) in your 100ms dashboard. This key and secret differ across workspaces so please ensure you are in the intended workspace before copying these credentials.

### Simplified token generation

We have simplified the process of management token generation for you within this collection:

-   All you have to do is update the **collection variables** `APP_ACCESS_KEY` and `APP_SECRET`;
-   We have added a pre-request script within the collection, which will generate the management token and set the same as a `collection variable` (TOKEN) in the forked Postman collection.
-   Automatically, this will be used as authentication for all the APIs in the 100ms collection.

> **Note:** Refer to the [authentication and tokens guide](https://100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/introduction/authentication-and-tokens#code-sample-generate-management-token) for more generating the management token in your preferred programming language for your development/production environment.

## Example: Create a room

Let's try to create a room to see how the 100ms collection works. From the forked REST API collection, select the folder named **Room APIs **and select the request to `create room`. Replace the placeholders like name, description, template_id, etc with the desired values. Click the `Send` button once done.

## Managing authentication for multiple workspaces in Postman

You can use the environment variables in postman to maintain authentication for multiple 100ms workspaces. An example use case for it is managing API authentication for Development, QA and Production workspaces. You can learn more about environment variables in Postman here.

You can setup environment variables using the steps below:

1. Hover over to Environments in the Postman sidebar. Click on Create an Environment.

  ![Environment Setup Step 1](/docs/docs/v2/environment_postman_step_1.png)

2. Name your Environment (e.g Development Environment)

  ![Environment Setup Step 1](/docs/docs/v2/environment_postman_step_2.png)

3. Add two variables like shown in the screenshot i.e APP_ACCESS_KEY and APP_SECRET. Change the Type of APP_SECRET to secret.

  ![Environment Setup Step 1](/docs/docs/v2/environment_postman_step_3.png)

4. Go to the Developer section of your workspace and copy values for APP_ACCESS_KEY and APP_SECRET.

  ![Environment Setup Step 1](/docs/docs/v2/environment_postman_step_4.png)

5. Paste those values in the INITIAL VALUE column and Save your Environment.

  ![Environment Setup Step 1](/docs/docs/v2/environment_postman_step_5.png)

6. Head over to your 100ms API collection and then switch your environment to access the respective workspace.

  ![Environment Setup Step 1](/docs/docs/v2/environment_postman_step_6.png)

7. Similarly, you create other environments (e.g QA and Production) for different workspaces to maintain ease of authentication access.

Please note that these environments exist across your postman workspaces and hence would also be visible in the dropdown for other collections.


## API Reference

You can refer to the detailed[ API reference](/server-side/v2/Rooms/object) to understand the request/response structure better, request arguments, response variables, webhooks, etc.

## Stay up to date

Similar to how the forked repository on GitHub works, you can stay up to date with the 100ms master collection by pulling the changes.

In the forked collection of your Postman instance, Click on the 'three-dots(...) menu' next to the 'Save' button in the top right section and select `Pull changes` from the drop-down menu.
