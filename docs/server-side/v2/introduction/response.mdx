100ms API responds to all requests with a response in JSON format along with an HTTP status code to indicate whether the request was successful.

## HTTP status codes

All requests return one of these standard HTTP status codes

| Code               | Description                                                       |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 200 - OK           | The request has succeeded.                                        |
| 204 - No Content   | Resource deleted.                                                 |
| 401 - Unauthorized | No valid API management token provided.                           |
| 403 - Forbidden    | The API management token provided doesn't have enough permission. |
| 404 - Not Found    | The request resource was not found.                               |
| 500 - Server Error | Something went wrong with 100ms servers. (These are rare).        |

## Examples

### Successful requests

1.  **POST requests**: The response will contain a JSON object with parameters like the ID of the object, created time, updated time, status of the object, and some useful params.
2.  **GET requests**
    - Fetch a single resource: similar to POST requests.
    - List requests: The response will contain an array of objects with response arguments grouped specifically to each object.
3.  **Example**: Create a Room API response
    ```json
    {
        "id": "6316d5cfae8c4271df5d0554",
        "name": "new-room-1662440912",
        "enabled": true,
        "description": "",
        "customer_id": "627cdddff2e4e30487862ad1",
        "recording_source_template": true,
        "enabled_source_template": true,
        "recording": null,
        "template_id": "",
        "template": "",
        "region": "",
        "created_at": "2022-09-06T05:08:31.935Z",
        "updated_at": "2022-09-06T05:08:31.922Z",
        "active": true
    }
    ```

### Failed requests

* API responses with `4XX` and `5XX HTTP status codes` indicate that the request has failed.
* `4XX`: This can be either 401 or 403 or 404. You can refer to the [status codes section](#http-status-codes) for more information. Also, the response body will contain the error message that will help to resolve the error and resend the request.

    **Example**:
    ```json
    {
        "code": 404,
        "message": "Error: Room not found",
        "data": {
            "description": "Error: Room not found"
        }
    }
    ```

* `5XX`: Server errors. This happens when something is wrong with 100ms servers(these are rare).
