## Token Generation

Any service calling 100ms' REST APIs need to authenticate using a management token. You can generate Tokens via `Token Generation endpoint` that is provided by 100ms.

### Token Endpoint
After you're done with creating an account head over to the developer section of [100ms Dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/developer). You will find all `Access Credentials` here including `Token Endpoint`.

### Creating Room
Now to get `room_id` get over to [Room in Dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/rooms) and click on "Create Room" , While creating a room you can specify it's name, roles or enable recording.

You will now see "Room Details" section and we have a `room_id` created.

### Generating Token
Now that we have got our `Token Endpoint` and `room_id` we can now generate our own Token.

Replace `{Token Endpoint}` and `{room_id}` placeholders with your endpoint and roomId in the curl request below and then run the curl request in the terminal:


```bash
curl --request POST '{endpoint}/api/token' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{"user_id": "JohnDoe1", "role": "host", "room_id":"{room_id}"}'

# Example

curl --request POST 'https://prod-in.100ms.live/hmsapi/johndoe.app.100ms.live/api/token' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{"user_id": "JohnDoe1", "role": "host", "room_id":"60f534a3533226920b256128"}'
```
