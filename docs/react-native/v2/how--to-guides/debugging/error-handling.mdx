title: Error Handling
nav: 11.2
---

When interacting with the 100ms SDK using the `HMSSDK` instance, or joining and previewing the Room, it may encounter issues that it cannot automatically recover from, and app or user intervention may be required. In such cases, the 100ms SDK emits `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_ERROR` event with error encounter by it.

You can subscribe to `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_ERROR` event to get notified about the errors encountered by the SDK -

```js
// this function will be called with `error` as first parameter
const onError = (error: HMSException) => {
    // Logging error
    console.log(`${error.code} ${error.description}`);

    // You should handle error as per its' code
    // Each code represents different error. Read below section to get more details
    if (error.code === 4005 || error.code === 1003) {
        leaveMeeting();
    }
};

// Subscribe to get SDK errors
hmsInstance.addEventListener(HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_ERROR, onError);
```

## HMSException

Function subscribed to `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_ERROR` event is called with `error` object, which is an instance of `HMSException` class. Lets take a look at `HMSException` class interface -

```js
interface HMSException {
    code: number;
    description: string;
    isTerminal: boolean;
    canRetry?: boolean; // Android Only
    message?: string; // Android Only
    name?: string; // Android Only
    action?: string; // Android Only
}
```

Here are the details of each property of `HMSException` object:

### code

The `code` property denotes error code which a unique identifier for the error.

### description

The `description` property denotes what is the source of the error.

### isTerminal

The `isTerminal` property denotes wether error has caused the current session to terminate and the app will need to call join again to reconnect.

Terminal error example:

![Terminal Error](/docs/v2/flutter-errorCode-1003.png)

The error code `1003` (error in above image) occurs when the reconnection attempt fails. The SDK returns this error after attempting to reconnect for 60 seconds. In such cases, the `isTerminal` property can be used to handle updates to the UI.

### canRetry

It is an `android` only property. The `canRetry` property denotes wether app can call join again with the same configuration it has used before. The value be false in cases like token expiring or room getting locked. You can use this property while implementing infinite retry in your app.

### message

It is an `android` only property. The `message` property denotes error information.

### name

It is an `android` only property. The `name` property denotes error name.

### action

It is an `android` only property. The `action` property tells what to do when a error occurs. For example `SEND_ALL_REQUIRED_KEYS` means you have not sent some required key in the API call.

## Different Error Types

Following are the different errors emitted by the SDK with their codes and action you should take to resolve the error -

| **Error Code** | **Cause of the error**                                                                                                              | **Action to be taken**                                                                                              |

## Setting log levels in SDK (Android Only)

Logs can be used to diagnose the performance of room sessions or debug various issues. To enable logging, create an `HMSLogSettings` object and pass it to the `build` method when constructing the `HMSSDK` instance.

The SDK also provides an option to save these logs to disk on **Android devices** using the `isLogStorageEnabled` property of the `HMSLogSettings` object. You can set the `isLogStorageEnabled` property to `true` to enable the SDK to write logs to the disk.

```js
// Creating the Log Settings object with disk storage turned on
const logSettings = new HMSLogSettings({
  level: HMSLogLevel.VERBOSE,
  isLogStorageEnabled: true,
  maxDirSizeInBytes: HMSLogAlarmManager.DEFAULT_DIR_SIZE, // Maximum size of the directory where log will be saved
});

// Pass the Log Settings object to the build function

const hmsInstance = await HMSSDK.build({ logSettings });
```

`HMSLogLevel` is an enum with values -

```js
export enum HMSLogLevel {
