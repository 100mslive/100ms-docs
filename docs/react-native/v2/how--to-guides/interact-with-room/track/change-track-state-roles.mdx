title: Change Track State For Roles
nav: 8.32

You're running a video call room and decide that someone who's currently talking shouldn't be talking.

You'd prefer they'd stay mute. Or perhaps you want their video turned off as well as their audio. You're looking for a remote mute.

Muting can apply to both audio and video.

## Unmuting

You may also decide that you want to let someone else speak who was currently muted. Or may want to ask someone to turn on their video.

You can request people to unmute themselves as well.

## Check if user has permissions

Can't let just anyone mute others. First you need to create a role with the permissions to mute others and also to ask them to unmute.

The permission to mute others is within PermissionsParams mute and you should check for that within the HMSRole of the peer to see if they have it.

Similarly the permission to unmute other peers is within PermissionsParams unmute.

Here's how to check whether the local peer has the permission to mute or unmute others:

```js
const mute: boolean = peer.role.permissions.mute;
const unmute: boolean = peer.role.permissions.unmute;
```

## Example

Imagine a room with 10 people having 7 listeners & 3 speakers. You want to unmute audio/video of all the speakers and mute audio/video of all the listeners.

## Muting/Unmuting

There are two APIs for muting/unmuting.

-   One which only works on a single track (audio/video) for a single peer at a time. [Learn more about API here.](/react-native/v2/how--to-guides/interact-with-room/track/remote-mute)

-   One which can mute multiple tracks for multiple peers. Either by their role, or track source or track type or any combination of the above.

## Multiple Peers or Tracks

Once you have checked that the caller has permissions to mute another peer's audio or video, call `hmsInstance.changeTrackStateForRoles`.

To mute audio for a multiple peers or tracks:

`hmsInstance.changeTrackStateForRoles` takes four parameters

-   `Mute` Boolean true if the track needs to be muted, false otherwise
-   `Type` Optional, the HMSTrackType which should be affected. If this and source are specified, it is considered an `AND operation`. If null, all track sources are affected.
-   `Source` Optional, the HMSTrackSource which should be affected. If this and type are specified, it is considered an `AND operation`. If null, all track sources are affected.
-   `Roles` Array of HMSRole optional, may have a single item in a array, whose tracks should be affected. If null, all roles are affected.

Here's an example of how you would check if the caller was allowed to mute peers and then call for a mute/unmute on all peers in the chat.

```js
// instance acquired from build() method
await hmsInstance
    ?.changeTrackStateForRoles(true, undefined, undefined, [hmsInstance?.knownRoles])
    .then((d) => console.log('Change Track State Roles Success: ', d))
    .catch((e) => console.log('Change Track State Roles Error: ', e));
```

This can be further narrowed by specifying only those tracks of type Audio.

Note that `HMSTrackSource.REGULAR` is the peer's own audio and video as opposed to one provided by screenshare or a plugin.

```js
import { HMSTrackType, HMSTrackSource } from '@100mslive/react-native-hms';

// instance acquired from build() method
await hmsInstance
    ?.changeTrackStateForRoles(true, HMSTrackType.AUDIO, HMSTrackSource.REGULAR, [
        hmsInstance?.knownRoles
    ])
    .then((d) => console.log('Change Track State Roles Success: ', d))
    .catch((e) => console.log('Change Track State Roles Error: ', e));
```
