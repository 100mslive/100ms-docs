Mute is something that applies to both audio and video and its possible to **mute remote peers only for yourself**. When you will mute audio or video track of remote peer, you won't be able to hear or see the remote person but it will be audible and visible to others.

You can use "Playback Allowed" API to "mute Audio and/or Video" or "check mute status" of Remote Peers only for yourself (locally).

If you set "Playback Allowed" to `false`, then it means remote peers' tracks can't be played, meaning "Mute Status" is set to `true` and vice-versa.

## Check Mute Status of Remote Peers locally

To check playback allowed status, you can call `isPlaybackAllowed` method on `HMSRemoteAudioTrack` and `HMSRemoteVideoTrack` objects available on `HMSRemotePeer` object. You can get list of `HMSRemotePeer` objects from `getRemotePeers` method available on `HMSSDK` instance created using build method.

```js
// getting list of Remote Peers
const remotePeers = await hmsInstance.getRemotePeers();

// Make sure you have atleast one remote peer, otherwise list will be empty, and firstRemotePeer will be `undefined`
const firstRemotePeer = remotePeers[0];

// Checking mute status of first remote peer
const isAudioPlaybackAllowed = firstRemotePeer.remoteAudioTrack().isPlaybackAllowed();
const isVideoPlaybackAllowed = firstRemotePeer.remoteVideoTrack().isPlaybackAllowed();
```

## Muting Remote Peers for yourself (locally)

To change playback allowed status, you can call `setPlaybackAllowed` method on `HMSRemoteAudioTrack` and `HMSRemoteVideoTrack` objects available on `HMSRemotePeer` object with `true` or `false` values. You can get list of `HMSRemotePeer` objects from `getRemotePeers` method available on `HMSSDK` instance created using build method.

You can set playback for a certain remote peer's audio or video. If you set it to false it will turn off the audio or video only for you. You can revert it back by setting it true.

> Note: If you want to Mute/Unmute a remote peer **for the whole room**, check out [Mute Remote Peer Docs](/react-native/v2/how--to-guides/interact-with-room/track/remote-mute)

```js
// getting list of Remote Peers
const remotePeers = await hmsInstance.getRemotePeers();

// Make sure you have atleast one remote peer, otherwise list will be empty, and firstRemotePeer will be `undefined`
const firstRemotePeer = remotePeers[0];

// Changing mute status of first remote peer for yourself only
firstRemotePeer.remoteAudioTrack().setPlaybackAllowed(false);
firstRemotePeer.remoteVideoTrack().setPlaybackAllowed(true);
```

## Muting "Audio" of All Remote Peers for yourself (locally)

You can mute "audio" of all remote peers at once for yourself. Use `setPlaybackForAllAudio` method available on `HMSSDK` instance created using build method with `true` or `false` values.

```js
hmsInstance.setPlaybackForAllAudio(true); // Mute Locally only
hmsInstance.setPlaybackForAllAudio(false); // Unmute Locally only
```
