title: Set Volume

Sometimes during calls, we need to deafen or turn up a particular peer's volume. For example, suppose a remote peer is too loud compared to others, you may want reduce their volume level and vice-versa.

100ms SDK gives you option to adjust volume of a remote peer's audio. The change in volume level is only effective locally, remote peers remains unaffected. That means only you will hear the lower/higher volume of that Peer. Other peers in Room will continue to listen at the default volume level as before.

You can use `setVolume` method available on `HMSSDK` instance to change volume levels of a remote peer. This method accepts 2 parameters as follows -

1. `track`: `HMSTrack` object of the **audio track** of **remote peer**.
2. `volume`: New volume level in `number`. It can be in range of `0`(min) to `10`(max). The default value is `1.0`.

An example of using `setVolume` method when track is added -

```js
const onTrackListener = ({
    peer,
    track,
    type
}: {
    peer: HMSPeer,
    track: HMSTrack,
    type: HMSTrackUpdate
}) => {
    if (
        type === HMSTrackUpdate.TRACK_ADDED && // When track is added
        track.type === HMSTrackType.AUDIO && // Making sure track is audio track
        peer.isLocal === false // Making sure peer is remote peer
    ) {
        // Increasing volume level of newly added audio track of remote peer
        hmsInstance.setVolume(track, 10.0);
    }
};

hmsInstance.addEventListener(HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_TRACK_UPDATE, onTrackListener);
```

> Volume level can vary from 0(min) to 10(max). The default value for volume would be 1.0
