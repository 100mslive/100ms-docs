`Role` is a powerful concept that takes a lot of complexity away in handling permissions and supporting features like breakout rooms.

Each `HMSPeer` instance has a `role` property which returns an `HMSRole` instance. You can use this property to do the following:

1. Check what this Role is allowed to publish, that is can it publish a video (and at what resolution)? Can it publish audio? Can it share a screen? Who can this role subscribe to?

For example, a Student Role can only see the Teacher's video. This is can be discovered by checking `publishSettings` and `subscribeSettings` properties.

2. Check what actions this Role can perform. i.e can it change someone else's current Role, End the Meeting, or remove someone from the room. This is can be discovered by checking the `permissions` property.

In certain scenarios, you may want to change someone's role.

Imagine an audio room with 2 roles `speaker` and `listener`. Only someone with a `speaker` role can publish audio to the room while a `listener` can only subscribe.

Now at some point, the `speaker` may decide to nominate some `listener` to become a `speaker`.

This is where Change Role capabilities come in play.

You may choose to do either:

1. [Single Peer Role Change](#single-peer-role-change): Change the role of a single peer to a specified one using the `changeRoleOfPeer` API

2. [Bulk Role Change](#bulk-role-change): Change the role of all peers with a certain role, to a specified one using the `changeRoleOfPeersWithRoles` API

## Single Peer Role Change

To invoke the API you will need 3 parameters -

-   `forPeer`: An instance of `HMSPeer` of the peer who's role you want to change.

-   `toRole`: The `HMSRole` instance for the target role.

-   `force`: Whether you want to change their role without asking them or give them a chance to accept/reject.

All the peers that are in the current room are accessible via the `peers` property of the `HMSRoom` instance.

A list of all available roles in the current room can be accessed via the `getRoles` method of `HMSSDK` instance.

Now with all the parameters you can invoke the `changeRoleOfPeer` API:

```js
import { HMSRole, HMSRemotePeer } from '@100mslive/react-native-hms';

try {
    const force = false;
    // instance acquired from build() method
    const result = await hmsInstance.changeRoleOfPeer(peer, newRole, force); // request role change, not forced
    console.log('Change Role Success: ', result);
} catch (error) {
    console.log('Change Role Error: ', error);
}
```

> Note: `changeRoleOfPeer` success doesn't mean that the role was changed, it just means that the server accepted the request as valid.

> Note: ðŸ”‘ `changeRoleOfPeer` is the same as `changeRole` but we have deprecated `changeRole` and it will be removed in future releases. So, Please use `changeRoleOfPeer`.

If the changing role succeeds, you will get an update in the `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_PEER_UPDATE` event with `HMSPeerUpdate.ROLE_CHANGED` update type:

```js
const onPeerListener = ({ peer, type }: { peer: HMSPeer, type: HMSPeerUpdate }) => {
    if (type === HMSPeerUpdate.ROLE_CHANGED) {
        // Role was changed of {peer}, New role is {peer.role}
        // Update your app UI here
    }
};

hmsInstance.addEventListener(HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_PEER_UPDATE, onPeerListener);
```

Registered `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_PEER_UPDATE` event listener will receive the same peer, you passed as targetPeer and an `HMSPeerUpdate.ROLE_CHANGED` update type.

## Accept Single Peer Role Change request

When a peer wishes to change the role of another peer it calls `changeRoleOfPeer` with a parameter `force`.

-   When `force` is set to `true` - role is directly changed and the peers receives an `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_PEER_UPDATE` event with `HMSPeerUpdate.ROLE_CHANGED` update type.

-   When `force` is set to `false` - This is a polite request e.g. "Would you like to change your role from listener to speaker?". Which can be ignored by the peer. The way it works is that the target peer will first receive a "Role Change Request" by `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_ROLE_CHANGE_REQUEST` event. If the request is accepted, the peers receives an `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_PEER_UPDATE` event with `HMSPeerUpdate.ROLE_CHANGED` update type otherwise nothing happens.

Let's understand this with a diagram:

![accept-change-role](/docs/v2/flutter-accept-role-change.png)

Now let's do it step-by-step:

<div className="steps-container">

### PeerA calls changeRoleOfPeer with force as false

```js
try {
    const force = false;
    // instance acquired from build() method
    const result = await hmsInstance.changeRoleOfPeer(peer, newRole, force); // request role change, not forced
    console.log('Change Role Success: ', result);
} catch (error) {
    console.log('Change Role Error: ', error);
}
```

### PeerB receives Role Change Request

PeerB receive a "Role Change Request" by `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_ROLE_CHANGE_REQUEST` event -

```js
// `HMSRoleChangeRequest` is a class that contains info about the role change request.
interface HMSRoleChangeRequest {
  requestedBy: HMSPeer; // This is an `HMSPeer` object which contains info about the peer who performed the role change
  suggestedRole: HMSRole; // This is an `HMSRole` object which contains info about the destination role
}

...

const onRoleChangeRequest = ({
  requestedBy,
  suggestedRole
}: HMSRoleChangeRequest) => {
  // open a prompt to accept or reject the request
};

hmsInstance.addEventListener(HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_ROLE_CHANGE_REQUEST, onRoleChangeRequest);
```

At this point, the app should show a prompt to the user asking for permission to accept or deny role change request.

### PeerB accepts Role Change request

Role Change request can be accepted by calling `acceptRoleChange` method on `HMSSDK` instance -

```js
try {
    // call `acceptRoleChange` if you want to accept role change else close the prompt
    await hmsInstance.acceptRoleChange();
    console.log('Accept change role Success');
} catch (error) {
    console.log('Accept change role Error: ', error);
}
```

If the user wants to ignore the request, he/she can just dismiss the prompt.

### All the peers receive Peer Role Change update

Now, all peers in the room will receive an `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_PEER_UPDATE` event with `HMSPeerUpdate.ROLE_CHANGED` update type so that they can do the necessary UI updates. PeerB will have all the permissions of new role.

```js
const onPeerListener = ({ peer, type }: { peer: HMSPeer, type: HMSPeerUpdate }) => {
    if (type === HMSPeerUpdate.ROLE_CHANGED) {
        // Role was changed of {peer}, New role is {peer.role}
        // Update your app UI here
    }
};

hmsInstance.addEventListener(HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_PEER_UPDATE, onPeerListener);
```

</div>

### Force Role Change Request case

Now let's imagine the newly nominated speaker is not behaving nicely and we want to move him back to the listener without a prompt. This is where the force parameter comes in.

When `force` is set to true the other party will not receive a confirmation `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_ROLE_CHANGE_REQUEST` event, but instead will straight away receive a new set of updated permissions and will stop publishing audio. Note that `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_PEER_UPDATE` event with `HMSPeerUpdate.ROLE_CHANGED` update type will still be emitted so that the app can update the user's UI state.

## Bulk Role Change

Bulk Role Change is used when we want to change the role of peers with a specific role to another role.

For example, if peers join a room with a `waiting` role and now you want to change all these peers to `viewer` role then use the `changeRoleOfPeersWithRoles` method.

It takes fewer parameters than for a single peer. Here is the method signature:

```js
changeRoleOfPeersWithRoles = async (ofRoles: HMSRole[], toRole: HMSRole) => { ... };
```

1. `toRole` is the `HMSRole` they should be changed to.
2. `ofRoles` is a list of `HMSRole` whose role should be changed.

Here's how the method could be called to change all `waiting` and `guest` roles to `host`:

```js
// fetch all available Roles in the room
const roles = await hmsInstance.getRoles();

// get the Host Role object
const hostRole = roles.find((role) => role.name === 'host');

// get list of Roles to be updated - in this case "Waiting" and "Guest" Roles
const rolesToChange = roles.filter((role) => role.name === 'waiting' || role.name === 'guest');

// now perform Role Change of all peers in "Waiting" and "Guest" Roles to the "Host" Role
await hmsInstance.changeRoleOfPeersWithRoles(rolesToChange, hostRole);
```

### Edge cases with bulk role change

1. Note that if an empty list is sent to `ofRoles`, no roles will be changed. This is to avoid accidentally changing roles you may not have intended such as the bots that provide recording and streaming with the roles `beam`.

2. Also, Bulk Role Changes are always forced, that is no option will be given for the peer to accept it, they will just be changed immediately.
