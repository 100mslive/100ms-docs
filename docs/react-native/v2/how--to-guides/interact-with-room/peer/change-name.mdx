Any peer can change their own name before or after joining a room. Before joining, the name would have to be specified in `HMSConfig` that is passed
to the join method. This document shows how the name can be changed after joining.

## Changing the name

The peer who wants to change their name should call the `changeName` method on `HMSSDK` instance with the new name.

```js
try {
    const newName = 'new name';
    await hmsInstance.changeName(newName);

    console.log('Change Name Success');
} catch (error) {
    console.log('Change Name Error: ', error);
}
```

## Responding to name changes

Once the name change is successful, all the peers receive `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_PEER_UPDATE` event with `HMSPeerUpdate.NAME_CHANGED` as update type.
When this event is received, the UI for that peer should be updated.

```js
const onPeerListener = ({ peer, type }: { peer: HMSPeer, type: HMSPeerUpdate }) => {
    if (type === HMSPeerUpdate.NAME_CHANGED) {
        // Name Changed for Peer
        console.log(`Update UI of ${peer.name}`);
    }
};

hmsInstance.addEventListener(HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_PEER_UPDATE, onPeerListener);
```
