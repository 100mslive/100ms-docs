Someone's overstayed their welcome and now you need to remove a peer from the video call room. `removePeer` method of `HMSSDK` instance comes to rescue.

## Permissions

Can't let just anyone remove others from the video call room. First, you need to create a [role](/concepts/v2/concepts/templates-and-roles) with the permissions to remove others.

Only the peers who has role with remove permissions allowed will be able to Remove peers from the Room.

You can check if you (local peer) have permission to remove peers as follows -

```ts
const localPeer = await hmsInstance.getLocalPeer();

// Permissions are available on `HMSRole` object of Local Peer
const localPeerPermissions: HMSPermissions = localPeer.role?.permissions;

// Check if Local Peer has Remove Peer Permission
const canRemoveOthers: boolean = localPeerPermissions?.removeOthers;
```

## Remove Peers

You can use `removePeer` method available on `HMSSDK` instance to remove peers from the room.

`removePeer` method accepts two parameters:

1. _peer_: `HMSPeer` object of the peer that you want to remove
2. _reason_: `string` reason for removal. Target Peer will receive this reason in `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_REMOVED_FROM_ROOM` event

Make sure you have above mentioned permission for `removePeer` to work.

```js
try {
    const reason = 'removed from room';

    await hmsInstance.removePeer(peer, reason); // peer is `HMSPeer` object of the peer to remove
    console.log('Remove Peer Success');
} catch (error) {
    console.log('Remove Peer Error: ', error);
}
```

## Remove Peer Notification

This section explains how to handle the app UI when you (local peer) are removed from the room by someone else.

Once the peer with adequate permissions calls `removePeer`, the removed peer will receive a `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_REMOVED_FROM_ROOM` event.

You can update your apps' UI and [Free Resources](/react-native/v2/how--to-guides/set-up-video-conferencing/release-resources) on receive of `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_REMOVED_FROM_ROOM` event.

```js
const onRemovedFromRoom = (data: {
    requestedBy: HMSPeer | null,
    reason: string,
    roomEnded: boolean
}) => {
    // Free App resources and do cleanup
    destroy();

    // Redirect to home screen or Navigate away from Meeting screen
    navigation.navigate('Home');
};

hmsInstance.addEventListener(HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_REMOVED_FROM_ROOM, onRemovedFromRoom);
```

> ðŸ’¡ Note: This is the same event that will be emitted if a peer [ends the room](/react-native/v2/how--to-guides/interact-with-room/room/end-room). Except that `roomEnded` will be `false` when a peer is removed from room.

Description of keys of data received from `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_REMOVED_FROM_ROOM` event:

-   _reason_: The `string` message detailing why the peer was removed.
-   _requestedBy_: `HMSPeer` object of the peer who called `removePeer`.
-   _roomEnded_: `false` if only the receiving peer(local peer) was removed. `true` if the entire room was ended.
