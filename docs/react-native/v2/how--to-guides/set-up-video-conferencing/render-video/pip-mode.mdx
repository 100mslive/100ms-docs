100ms React Native SDK provides support for creating Picture in Picture mode experience for video calls.

PIP Mode lets the user watch the room video in a small window pinned to a corner of the screen while navigating between apps or browsing content on the main screen.

Currently this functionality is only available on Android.

## Minimum Requirements

-   Minimum version required to support PiP is Android 8.0 (API level 26)
-   Minimum `react-native-hms` SDK version required is 1.0.0

### How to add PiP support

1. You need to update the activity tag in the `AndroidManifest.xml`

```xml
  <activity
    ....
    android:supportsPictureInPicture="true"
    android:configChanges="keyboard|keyboardHidden|orientation|screenSize|smallestScreenSize|screenLayout|uiMode"
    ... />
```

2. Call `enablePipMode` method on "HMS Instance" when you want to start PIP mode.

```js
// You can also check if PIP is supported on device or not.
const isPIPSupported = await hmsInstance.isPipModeSupported();

const isEnabled = await hmsInstance.enablePipMode();
if (isEnabled) {
    // App has entered into PIP Mode
    setPIPModeActive(true);
}
```


While enabling PIP Mode you can configure the PIP Window Aspect Ratio & buttons shown to perform actions.


Actionable buttons like Mute/Unmute Audio/Video, Leave Room for local peers can be customized while enabling PIP Mode.


- `aspectRatio`: The Aspect Ratio of the PIP Window which will be appear. Default value is 16:9 aspect ratio. Other commonly used values are 4:3, 1:1, 9:16 & 3:4 ratios.

- `endButton`: To enable/disable showing of a button through which user can leave the room. Default is false, so the button is not visible by default.

- `videoButton`: To enable/disable showing of a button through which user can Mute/Unmute their Video Camera. Default is false, so the button is not visible by default.

- `audioButton`: To enable/disable showing of a button through which user can Mute/Unmute their Video Camera. Default is false, so the button is not visible by default.


```js
const isEnabled = await hmsInstance?.enablePipMode({
                          aspectRatio: [9, 16],   // for 9:16 aspect ratio
                          endButton: true,        // for showing/hiding leave room button
                          videoButton: true,      // for showing/hiding local Video button
                          audioButton: true,      // for showing/hiding local Audio button
                        });
```

Pip mode resizes your whole activity to a small container. So, you should hide the content that you don't want to show.

3. Detect when App goes to "fullscreen" from PIP mode

```js
  import { AppState, AppStateStatus } from 'react-native';

  ...

  const appStateRef = useRef(AppState.currentState);

  useEffect(() => {
    // We will register an AppState listener when App is in PIP Mode
    if (pipModeActive) {
      appStateRef.current = AppState.currentState;

      const appStateListener = (nextAppState: AppStateStatus) => {
        if (
          appStateRef.current.match(/inactive|background/) &&
          nextAppState === "active"
        ) {
          // Now, App is not in PIP mode
          setPIPModeActive(false);
        }

        appStateRef.current = nextAppState;
      };

      AppState.addEventListener('change', appStateListener);

      return () => {
        AppState.removeEventListener('change', appStateListener);
      }
    }
  }, [pipModeActive]);
```

### Example of showing content when App is in PIP Mode

```js
  // Getting trackId to show in PIP mode
  // getPreferredTrackId function returns trackId of preferred video track
  const pipTrackId = getPreferredTrackId()

  ...

  // If PIP mode is active, showing only single peer
  if (isPipModeActive) {
    return (
      <HmsView
        ...
        trackId={pipTrackId}
        ...
      />
    )
  }

  // Showing tiles for all the peers
  return <MultiplePeers />

  ...
```

## Checkout Video of PIP in Action

<video width="295" height="640" controls>

        type="video/mp4"
    />
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
