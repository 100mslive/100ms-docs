### Quickstart

If you want to see 100ms' SDKs in action in under 5 minutes, run one of our quickstart [apps](../guides/quickstart)

### Github Repo
You can checkout the 100ms React Native SDK Github repo which also contains a fully fledged [Example app implementation here](https://github.com/100mslive/react-native-hms/) 

### Example App

In the [100ms Example App](https://github.com/100mslive/react-native-hms/tree/main/example) we have shown how to setup the various listeners, what data to store in the redux and what all features you can implement.

We have also implemented multiple views which are commonly used. Checkout the [videos & relevant code in the Example app](https://github.com/100mslive/react-native-hms/tree/main/example#additional-features).
