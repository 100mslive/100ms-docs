title: RTC Call Stats
nav: 3.998
---

Sometimes you need a way to capture certain metrics related to a call. This may be helpful 
if you want to tailor the experience to your users or debug issues. Typical metrics of interest 
are audio/video bitrate, round trip time, total consumed bandwidth and packet loss. 100ms SDK 
provides this data via dedicated delegate callbacks found in HMSUpdateListener. These will be 
called with a fixed interval of one second after a room has been joined. You can get stats on a 
per track basis (`on(remoteAudioStats:track:peer)`) or as an overall summary (`on(rtcStats:)`)

Here is the full list of callbacks:

```js
import { HMSUpdateListenerActions } from '@100mslive/react-native-hms';

// hms instance aquired from build method
hmsInstance?.addEventListener(
  HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_LOCAL_AUDIO_STATS,
  onChangeLocalAudioStats,
);
hmsInstance?.addEventListener(
  HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_LOCAL_VIDEO_STATS,
  onChangeLocalVideoStats,
);
hmsInstance?.addEventListener(
  HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_RTC_STATS,
  onChangeRtcStats,
);
hmsInstance?.addEventListener(
  HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_REMOTE_AUDIO_STATS,
  onChangeRemoteAudioStats,
);
hmsInstance?.addEventListener(
  HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_REMOTE_VIDEO_STATS,
  onChangeRemoteVideoStats,
);
```

## Enable RTC call stats
```js
hmsInstance?.enableRTCStats();
```

## Disable  RTC call stats
```js
hmsInstance?.disableRTCStats();
```

## HMSRTCStatsReport
This class will contain the combined stats for the room.
```js 
class HMSRTCStats {
    // Total bytes sent in the current session.
    var bytesSent: UInt64
    // Total bytes received in the current session.
    var bytesReceived: UInt64
    // Total packets received in the current session.
    var packetsReceived: UInt64
    // Total packets lost in the current session.
    var packetsLost: UInt64
    // Total outgoing bitrate observed since previous report.
    var bitrateSent: Double
    // Total incoming bitrate observed since previous report in Kb/s.
    var bitrateReceived: Double
    // Average round trip time observed since previous report in Kb/s.
    var roundTripTime: Double
}

class HMSRTCStatsReport {
    // Combined audio + video values
    var combined: HMSRTCStats
    // Summary of all audio tracks
    var audio: HMSRTCStats
    // Summary of all video tracks
    var video: HMSRTCStats
}
```

## HMSLocalAudioStats
This class contains stats related to local audio track.
```js
class HMSLocalAudioStats {
    // Round trip time observed since previous report.
    var roundTripTime: Double
    // Total bytes sent by this track in the current session.
    var bytesSent: UInt64
    // Outgoing bitrate of this track observed since previous report in Kb/s.
    var bitrate: Double
}
```

## HMSLocalVideoStats
This class contains stats related to local video track.
```js
class HMSLocalVideoStats {
    // Round trip time observed since previous report.
    var roundTripTime: Double
    // Total bytes sent by this track in the current session.
    var bytesSent: UInt64
    // Outgoing bitrate of this track observed since previous report in Kb/s.
    var bitrate: Double
    // Resolution of video frames being sent.
    var resolution: HMSVideoResolution
    // Frame rate of video frames being sent (FPS).
    var frameRate: Double
}
```
## HMSRemoteAudioStats
This class contains stats related to remote audio track.
```js
class HMSRemoteAudioStats {
    // Packet Jitter measured in seconds for this track. Calculated as defined in section 6.4.1. of RFC3550.
    var jitter: Double
    // Total bytes received by this track in the current session.
    var bytesReceived: UInt64
    // Incoming bitrate of this track observed since previous report in Kb/s.
    var bitrate: Double
    // Total packets received by this track in the current session.
    var packetsReceived: UInt64
    // Total packets lost by this track in the current session.
    var packetsLost: UInt64
}
```

## HMSRemoteVideoStats
This class contains stats related to remote video track.
```js
class HMSRemoteVideoStats {
    // Packet Jitter measured in seconds for this track. Calculated as defined in section 6.4.1. of RFC3550.
    var jitter: Double
    // Total bytes received by this track in the current session.
    var bytesReceived: UInt64
    // Incoming bitrate of this track observed since previous report in Kb/s.
    var bitrate: Double
    // Total packets received by this track in the current session.
    var packetsReceived: UInt64
    // Total packets lost by this track in the current session.
    var packetsLost: UInt64
    // Resolution of video frames being received.
    var resolution: HMSVideoResolution
    // Frame rate of video frames being received (FPS).
    var frameRate: Double
}
```
