Want to preserve your video call for posterity in a recording? Or live stream it out to millions of viewers on Twitch or YouTube or whatever gives you an RTMP ingest URL?

Turn on RTMP Streaming or Recording!

In 100ms, recording and streaming is usually achieved by having a bot join your room and stream what it sees and hears to a file (recording) or an RTMP ingest URL (streaming).


## Types of Recordings 

Apart from the RTMP stream and the browser recording, there is also a Server Recording, which can be turned on for the room.

### - Server Recording 

This is used for archival purposes and cannot be stopped by method calls from SDK. This can only be enabled/disabled from the dashboard.
This represents that the room was set to be recorded when it was created and all sessions within it will always be recorded for archival by the server.

### - Browser Recording 

This is a normal recording that can be enabled/disabled using `HMSSDK` instance method `startRTMPOrRecording` with `record` property set to true.

## Permissions

Can't let just anyone record and stream room audio and video. First, you need to create a [role](../foundation/templates-and-roles) with the permissions to record and stream room.

You can check if you (local peer) have permission to record and stream room as follows -

```ts
const localPeer = await hmsInstance.getLocalPeer();

// Permissions are available on `HMSRole` object of Local Peer
const localPeerPermissions: HMSPermissions = localPeer.role?.permissions;

// Check if Local Peer has Room Recording Permission
const canRecord: boolean = localPeerPermissions?.browserRecording;

// Check if Local Peer has Room Streaming Permission
const canStream: boolean = localPeerPermissions?.rtmpStreaming;
```


## Start Streaming / Recording

Let's understand the process by following steps:

<div className="steps-container">

### Create an HMSRTMPConfig instance

`HMSRTMPConfig` object will be used to start the Room recording and streaming.

```js
import { HMSRTMPConfig } from '@100mslive/react-native-hms';

const roomJoinLink = 'https://...app.100ms.live/streaming/meeting...';

const recordingConfig = new HMSRTMPConfig({
  meetingURL: `${roomJoinLink}/viewer?token=beam_recording`,
  rtmpURLs: [],
  record: true,
});
```

Let's look at how `HMSRTMPConfig` object looks like -

```js
interface HMSRTMPConfig {
  meetingURL: string;
  rtmpURLs?: string[];
  record: boolean;
  resolution?: HMSRtmpVideoResolution;
}
```

1. _meetingURL_: `string`, The URL that the 100ms bot user will open to join your room. It must allow access without any user-level interaction.
2. _rtmpURLs_: `string[]`, If streaming is required, this has to be one or more RTMP Ingest URLs with a max limit of 3 URLs where the stream should go. If only recording, this can be an empty list.

    - Format: `rtmp://server.com/app/STREAM_KEY`
    - Example: `rtmp://a.rtmp.youtube.com/live2/k0jv-329m-1y7f-ktth-ck48`
        - "rtmp://a.rtmp.youtube.com/live2/" - RTMP stream URL.
        - "k0jv-329m-1y7f-ktth-ck48" - RTMP stream key.

    <RtmpExternalConfig />

3. _record_: `boolean`, If the recording is required, set it `true`. If the recording is not required, set it to `false`. This value does not affect streaming.
4. _resolution_: `HMSRtmpVideoResolution`, An optional value for the output resolution of the stream. For instance, the default is a landscape at `1280x720` but this could be set for a portrait mode to `720x1280` or smaller values like `480x80`. The `HMSResolution` class takes `width` and `height`.


#### Key Notes

- If both `rtmpURLs` and `record = true` are provided, both streaming and recording will begin.
- If only `rtmpURLs` are provided, only streaming will begin.
- If only `record = true` is provided, only recording will begin.

If either one is started, the other can't be started without first stopping whatever is running.

> Eg: If only streaming is started then recording can't be started unless streaming is stopped first.

If both are required, they have to be started together by providing both `rtmpURLs` and `record = true`.

### Call method on HMSSDK instance

After creating config (`HMSRTMPConfig`) object, You can use `startRTMPOrRecording` method available on `HMSSDK` instance to start the RTMP Streaming and Recording as follows -

Make sure you have above mentioned permissions for starting RTMP streaming and recording.

```js
try {
  // Calling `startRTMPOrRecording` with config created in above step
  await hmsInstance.startRTMPOrRecording(recordingConfig);

  console.log('Start Recording Success');
} catch (error) {
  console.log('Start Recording Error: ', error);
}
```

</div>


## Stop Streaming / Recording

You can use `stopRtmpAndRecording` method available on `HMSSDK` instance to stop the RTMP Streaming and Recording.

Make sure you have above mentioned permissions for stopping RTMP streaming and recording.

```js
try {
  await hmsInstance.stopRtmpAndRecording();

  console.log('Stop Recording Success');
} catch (error) {
  console.log('Stop Recording Error: ', error);
}
```


## Current Room Status

The current status for the room is always reflected in the `HMSRoom` object which we can get from `getRoom` method available on `HMSSDK` instance or `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_ROOM_UPDATE` event.

This can be used to show the stream or recording status on UI something similar to this:

![stream-state](/docs/v2/flutter-stream-state.jpg)

Here are the relevant properties inside the `HMSRoom` object which we can read to get the current recording/streaming status of the room: 

- `rtmpHMSRtmpStreamingState` - Contains info about RTMP Streaming, `running` attribute if true indicates streaming is ON currently
- `browserRecordingState` - Contains info about Browser Recording, `running` attribute if true indicates browser recording is ON currently
- `serverRecordingState` - Contains info about Server Recording, `running` attribute if true indicates server recording is ON currently

Each of them is an object which contains a boolean `running` which lets you know if it's active in the room right now and `error` which lets you know if there was an error.

1. **rtmpHMSRtmpStreamingState** is an instance of `HMSRtmpStreamingState`, which looks like:

```js
interface HMSRtmpStreamingState {
  running: boolean; // `true` indicates that RTMP streaming is running
  error?: HMSException; // Gets populated if there is some error in starting the stream or recording
  startedAt: Date; // time at which RTMP streaming was started
  stoppedAt: Date; // time at which RTMP streaming was stopped
}
```

2. **browserRecordingState** is an instance of `HMSBrowserRecordingState`, which looks like:

```js
interface HMSBrowserRecordingState {
  running: boolean; // `true` indicates that browser recording is running 
  error?: HMSException; // Gets populated if there is some error in starting the browser recording 
  startedAt: Date; // time at which browser recording was started
  stoppedAt: Date; // time at which browser recording was stopped
}
```

3. **serverRecordingState** is an instance of `HMSServerRecordingState`, which looks like:

  This represents that the room was set to be recorded when it was created and all sessions within it will always be recorded for archival by the server.

```js
interface HMSServerRecordingState {
  running: boolean; // `true` indicates that server recording is running 
  error?: HMSException; // Gets populated if there is some error in starting the server recording
  startedAt: Date; // time at which server recording was started
}
```


## When to check for room status

The room status should be checked in any of the following ways -

1. Inside `onJoinListener` function which is subscribed to `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_JOIN` event
2. Inside `onRoomListener` function which is subscribed to `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_ROOM_UPDATE` event
3. When `hmsInstance.startRTMPOrRecording(recordingConfig)` is called
4. When `hmsInstance.stopRtmpAndRecording()` is called

-   In the above mentioned `onJoinListener` & `onRoomListener` functions, The properties mentioned above will be on the `HMSRoom` object.
-   Whenever either of the `startRTMPOrRecording` or `stopRtmpAndRecording` functions are called, the values of the streaming and recording will be updated on the room object available in `onRoomListener` function. So, You should update the instance of `HMSRoom` in your application at that time.
