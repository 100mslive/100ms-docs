**"These are Android only APIs."**

Audio Output Routing is helpful when users want to switch the audio output to a connected device other than the default one.

For example, you can implement an in-call speaker button that toggles audio output between the speaker, earpiece or any other connected earphones - wired or wireless, etc.

Let's see how we can use HMSSDK to implement this:

<div className="steps-container">

### Fetch Available Audio Devices

You can use `getAudioDevicesList` method available on `HMSSDK` instance to fetch the list of available audio devices.

```js
enum HMSAudioDevice {
  SPEAKER_PHONE = 'SPEAKER_PHONE',
  WIRED_HEADSET = 'WIRED_HEADSET',
  EARPIECE = 'EARPIECE',
  BLUETOOTH = 'BLUETOOTH',
  AUTOMATIC = 'AUTOMATIC',
}

...

try {
  // List of available devices
  const audioDevices: HMSAudioDevice[] = await hmsInstance.getAudioDevicesList();

  console.log('Get Audio Device List Success: ', audioDevices);
} catch (error) {
  console.log('Get Audio Device List Error: ', error);
}
```

`getAudioDevicesList` method returns list of `HMSAudioDevice` enum. `HMSAudioDevice` has following values -

- SPEAKER_PHONE - device speaker
- EARPIECE - device earpiece
- WIRED_HEADSET - connected wired device
- BLUETOOTH - connected Bluetooth device
- AUTOMATIC - other automatic device



### Switch Audio Focus to Another Device

You can use `switchAudioOutput` method available on `HMSSDK` instance to switch the device audio output to different device.

`switchAudioOutput` method takes a `HMSAudioDevice` as a parameter. You can pass any device from the device list you got from previous step (`getAudioDevicesList` method call).

```js
try {
  // List of available devices
  const audioDevices: HMSAudioDevice[] = await hmsInstance.getAudioDevicesList();

  // EARPIECE device
  const earpieceAudioDevice = audioDevices.find(audioDevice => audioDevice === HMSAudioDevice.EARPIECE);

  // Switching Audio Output from default to EARPIECE device
  hmsInstance.switchAudioOutput(earpieceAudioDevice);

  console.log('Switch Audio Output Success');
} catch (error) {
  console.log('Switch Audio Output Error: ', error);
}
```


### Receive the device change updates

You can add a listener to get updates whenever a audio device is removed or attached to the device such as Bluetooth, Wired Headset etc.

You can use `setAudioDeviceChangeListener` method available on `HMSSDK` instance to add device change listener.

`setAudioDeviceChangeListener` method takes a `callback` as a parameter, which will be called _when output device has changed_ or a _device is removed or attached_.

```js
const deviceChangeListener = (data: { device: HMSAudioDevice; audioDevicesList: HMSAudioDevice[] }) => {
  // `device` param - Focused Audio Device
  // `audioDevicesList` param - List of available Audio Devices

  console.log(`Audio Device Output changed to ${data.device}`);
};

hmsInstance.setAudioDeviceChangeListener(deviceChangeListener);
```

You can remove this listener as follows -

```js
hmsInstance.removeEventListener(HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_AUDIO_DEVICE_CHANGED);
```

</div>



## Get Current Focussed Device

You can use `getAudioOutputRouteType` method available on `HMSSDK` instance to get the current focused audio output device.

`getAudioOutputRouteType` method returns audio device of type `HMSAudioDevice`.

```js
try {
  const focusedAudioDevice: HMSAudioDevice = await hmsInstance.getAudioOutputRouteType();
  console.log('Get Audio Output Route Type Success: ', focusedAudioDevice);
} catch (error) {
  console.log('Get Audio Output Route Type Error: ', error);
}
```
