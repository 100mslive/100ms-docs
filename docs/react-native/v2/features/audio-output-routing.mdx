These are android only APIs. Audio Routing can be helpful in the case when user wants to switch output to device other than the default focussed one by SDK.

## Switch audio focus to another device

```js
fun switchAudioOutput(audioDevice: HMSAudioDevice)
```

Types of audio routing supported.

* SPEAKER - route audio to device speaker
* EARPIECE - route audio to device earpiece
* WIRED - route audio to connected wired device
* BLUETOOTH - route audio to connected bluetooth device
* AUTOMATIC - automatic routing

invoke this method with appropriate option , to switch the output to that device

`audioDevice` is the [AudioDevice] type through which audio should be routed.

```js
import { HMSAudioDevice } from '@100mslive/react-native-hms';

hmsInstance?.switchAudioOutput(HMSAudioDevice.EARPIECE)
```

## Adding a listener
```js
fun setAudioDeviceChangeListener(callback: Function)
```
Add a listener to get updates whenever a device is removed or attached to the device. Callback function to be passed to be able to listen to device updates.

Callback methods :

* callback passed - this method is invoked when output device has changed.
* onError listener - this method is invoked when there is an error with switching to output device.

```js
const onAudioDeviceChangedListener = (data: {
  device: string;
  audioDevicesList: string[];
}) => {
  // 
};
  
hmsInstance?.setAudioDeviceChangeListener(onAudioDeviceChangedListener)
```

## Get current focussed device

```js
async function getAudioOutputRouteType() : AudioDevice
```

invoke this method get current device type through which audio output is being routed.

```js
await hmsInstance?.getAudioOutputRouteType()
```

## Get list of audio device

```js
async function getAudioDevicesList() : AudioDevice[]
```

invoke this method get list of devices type through which audio output can be routed.

```js
await hmsInstance?.getAudioDevicesList()
```
