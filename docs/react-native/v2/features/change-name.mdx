Any peer can change their own name before or after joining a room. Before joining, the name would have to be specified in `HMSConfig` that is passed 
to the join method. This document shows how the name can be changed after joining.

## Responding to name changes
Whenever a remote peer's name is changed a callback will be received in `onPeerUpdate` where the update will be of type `HMSPeerUpdate.NAME_CHANGED`.
When this callback is received the UI for that peer should be updated as well.

## Changing the name
The peer who wants to change their name should call the following method on an HMSSdk instance.

```js
const newName: string = "new name"

// hms instance acquired by build method
hmsInstance.changeName(newName);
```
