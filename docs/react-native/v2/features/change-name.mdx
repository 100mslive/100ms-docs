Any peer can change their own name before or after joining a room. Before joining, the name would have to be specified in `HMSConfig` that is passed 
to the join method. This document shows how the name can be changed after joining.


## Changing the name

The peer who wants to change their name should call the `changeName` method on `HMSSDK` instance with the new name.

```js
try {
  const newName = "new name";
  await hmsInstance.changeName(newName);

  console.log('Change Name Success');
} catch (error) {
  console.log('Change Name Error: ', error);
}
```


## Responding to name changes

Once the name change is successful, all the peers receive `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_PEER_UPDATE` event with `HMSPeerUpdate.NAME_CHANGED` as update type.
When this event is received, the UI for that peer should be updated.

```js
const onPeerListener = ({
  peer,
  type,
}: {
  peer: HMSPeer;
  type: HMSPeerUpdate;
}) => {
  if (type === HMSPeerUpdate.NAME_CHANGED) {
    // Name Changed for Peer
    console.log(`Update UI of ${peer.name}`);
  }
};

hmsInstance.addEventListener(HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_PEER_UPDATE, onPeerListener);
```
