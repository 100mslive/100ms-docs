These are Android only APIs. This feature is the analog of screen capture, but for audio. There may be cases where the application needs to stream music which is either stored in the device locally or from some other app present on the device in the room where the peer is joined.

Examples of such use cases can be a FM like application where the host would want to stream music while also interacting with others in the room or a host in a gaming app who would want to stream music from their device in the room along with their regular audio track.

## How does audio share work
> Note: The Audio share option only works in Android 10 and above.

100ms SDK uses the [MediaProjection APIs](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/av-capture#capture_audio_playback) of Android to capture the device audio and stream it along with the user's regular audio track. To achieve this SDK starts a foreground service and starts capturing the device audio and mixes the bytes with the data collected from mic, so that the stream contains both system music and mic data.

This API gives apps the ability to copy the audio being played by other apps which have set its usage to USAGE_MEDIA, USAGE_GAME, or USAGE_UNKNOWN. (Audio from apps like youtube etc can be captured)

## How to stream device audio from the app

Add permission for `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` & `HMSAudioshareActivity` to manifest located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
```js
...
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />
...

...
<activity
  android:name="com.reactnativehmssdk.HMSAudioshareActivity"
  android:label="@string/app_name" />
...
```

To start streaming device audio , app needs to call the `startAudioshare` async method of `HMSSDK`, which takes in one parameter which is one of the modes of type `AudioMixingMode` in which the user wants to stream. This can be one out of the three available types - TALK_ONLY : only data captured by mic will be streamed in the room TALK_AND_MUSIC: data captured by mic as well as playback audio being captured from device will be streamed in the room MUSIC_ONLY: only the playback audio being captured from device will be streamed in the room.

Following is the snippet on how to use this:
```js
import { AudioMixingMode } from '@100mslive/react-native-hms';

await hmsInstance?.startAudioshare(AudioMixingMode.MUSIC_ONLY)
```

## How to stop audio sharing
To stop capturing device audio and streaming into the room, call the `stopAudioshare` API.

```js
await hmsInstance?.stopAudioshare()
```

## How to change mode
To change the mode while the user is streaming audio, call the `setAudioMixingMode` API and pass one of the modes out of `TALK_ONLY` or `TALK_AND_MUSIC` or `MUSIC_ONLY` enum available in `AudioMixingMode` class.

Note that `TALK_ONLY` mode is equivalent to regular mode, that is without starting this API.
```js
import { AudioMixingMode } from '@100mslive/react-native-hms';

await hmsInstance?.setAudioMixingMode(AudioMixingMode.MUSIC_ONLY)
```

## How to get Audio Share Status
Application needs to call the `isAudioShared` method of `HMSSDK`. This method returns a boolean which will be true 
incase Audioshare is currently active and being used, and false for inactive state.
```js
await hmsInstance?.isAudioShared()
    .then(d => console.log('Is Audioshared Success: ', d))
    .catch(e => console.log('Is Audioshared Error: ', e));
```
