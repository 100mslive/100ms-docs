When you make various function calls through HmsInstance, it may return errors with different error codes. ErrorCodes are returned when a problem that cannot be recovered without app intervention has occurred.

These are returned as HMSException in the onError callback of the HMSUpdateListner.

```js
// import HMSUpdateListenerActions class
import { HMSUpdateListenerActions, HMSException } from '@100mslive/react-native-hms';

// instance acquired from build() method
hmsInstance.addEventListener(HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_ERROR, onError);

const onError = (error: HMSException) => {
    if (Platform.OS === 'android') {
      if (data?.code === 4005 || data?.code === 1003) {
        destroy();
      }
    } else {
      if (data?.code === 2000) {
        destroy();
      }
    }
};
```
## HMSException Properties

### isTerminal

The isTerminal property denotes wether error has caused the current session to terminate and the app will need to call join again to reconnect. 

### description

The description property denotes what is the source of the error.

### code

The code property denotes error code which a unique identifier for the error.

### canRetry

It is a `iOS` only property. The canRetry property denotes wether app can call join again with the same configuration it has used before. The value be false in cases like token expiring or room getting locked. You can use this property while implementing infinite retry in your app.

### message

It is a `android` only property. The message property denotes error information.

### name

It is a `android` only property. The name property denotes error name.

### action

It is a `android` only property. The action property tells what to do when a error occurs. For example `SEND_ALL_REQUIRED_KEYS` means you have not sent some required key in the API call

Following are the different error codes that are returned in the callback . Before returning any error code, it retries the errors (whichever is possible).
