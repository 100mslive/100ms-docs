100ms React Native Package provides support for sharing the entire screen of the device to the room.

Please note that for a peer to share their screen, their role must have screenshare enabled in the dashboard. Also select the appropriate resolution for the Screen share quality. 1080p is recommended for better text readability.

## Android Setup

Add `HmsScreenshareActivity` to manifest located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` as follows -

```xml
<application
  android:name=".MainApplication"
  ...
  android:label="@string/app_name">

  ...
  <!-- Add below activity in your "application" tag -->
  <activity
    android:name="com.reactnativehmssdk.HmsScreenshareActivity"
    android:label="@string/app_name" />
  ...

</application>
```

## iOS Setup

You need to create an iOS broadcast upload extension. It uses Apple's ReplayKit framework to record the device screen and delivers frame samples to your broadcast extension. You can share not only your own app but also the entire device sceeen including other apps on the device.

<div className="steps-container">

### Step 1 - Open project
Open your iOS Xcode project `xed ios`.

### Step 2 - Add Broadcast Upload Extension
Click on your project in the Project Navigator to show the project settings. 
Press + at the bottom of the target list to add a new target.

![AddExtension](/docs/v2/RNAddExtension.png)

Select the `Broadcast Upload Extension` type for your new target.

![SelectExtension](/docs/v2/RNSelectExtension.png)

Enter your new target detail in the dialog.
Uncheck Include UI Extension option.

![DetailExtension](/docs/v2/RNDetailExtension.png)

In the following dialog, activate the new scheme for the new target.

![ActivateExtension](/docs/v2/RNActivateExtension.png)

### Step 3 - Add App Group

Click + icon in `Signing & Capabilities` section.
Select `App Group` from the list of Capabilities.

![AddAppgroup](/docs/v2/RNSelectAppGroup.png)

New section should be added under `Signing & Capabilities` named App Groups. Click + icon under that.

![Appgroup](/docs/v2/RNAddAppGroup.png)

Enter App group name (create unique app group name ex: group.your.domain.name)

![AppgroupDetail](/docs/v2/RNAddAppGroupName.png)

### Step 4 - Edit Podfile
In ios folder of your react project and open `Podfile`.
Paste the following code and replace the extension name you just created:
```
target 'RNHMSExampleBroadcastUpload' do
  use_modular_headers!
  pod 'HMSBroadcastExtensionSDK'
end
```
![Podfile](/docs/v2/RNPodfile.png)

In terminal change directory to ios and run `pod install` command.

### Step 5 - Edit SampleHandler
Expand `Runner > ExtensionName` and open SampleHandler file.

![SampleHandler](/docs/v2/RNSampleHandler.png)

Replace the code with the code below and pass app group name to the respected field:

```swift
import ReplayKit
import HMSBroadcastExtensionSDK

class SampleHandler: RPBroadcastSampleHandler {

    let screenRenderer = HMSScreenRenderer(appGroup: "group.reactnativehms")

    override func broadcastStarted(withSetupInfo setupInfo: [String : NSObject]?) {
        // User has requested to start the broadcast. Setup info from the UI extension can be supplied but optional.
    }

    override func broadcastPaused() {
        // User has requested to pause the broadcast. Samples will stop being delivered.
    }

    override func broadcastResumed() {
        // User has requested to resume the broadcast. Samples delivery will resume.
    }

    override func broadcastFinished() {
        // User has requested to finish the broadcast.
        screenRenderer.invalidate()
    }

    override func processSampleBuffer(_ sampleBuffer: CMSampleBuffer, with sampleBufferType: RPSampleBufferType) {
        switch sampleBufferType {
        case RPSampleBufferType.video:
            // Handle video sample buffer
            if let error = screenRenderer.process(sampleBuffer) {
                if error.code == .noActiveMeeting {
                    finishBroadcastWithError(NSError(domain: "ScreenShare",
                                                     code: error.code.rawValue,
                                                     userInfo: [NSLocalizedFailureReasonErrorKey : "You are not in a meeting."]))
                }
            }
            break
        case RPSampleBufferType.audioApp:
            // Handle audio sample buffer for app audio
            break
        case RPSampleBufferType.audioMic:
            // Handle audio sample buffer for mic audio
            break
        @unknown default:
            // Handle other sample buffer types
            fatalError("Unknown type of sample buffer")
        }
    }
}
```
</div>


## Start Screenshare

To start screen share, app needs to call the `startScreenshare` method of `HMSSDK` instance.

To start screen share in iOS you need to pass App Group and Preferred Extension name while creating HMSSDK instance as follows:

```js
// Create `HMSSDK` instance with `appGroup` and `preferredExtension` properties
const hmsInstance = await HMSSDK.build({
    appGroup: 'group.reactnativehms',
    preferredExtension: 'RHHMSExampleBroadcastUpload',
});

...

// Start Screenshare
try {
  await hmsInstance.startScreenshare();
  console.log('Start startScreenshare Success');
} catch(error) {
  console.log('Start startScreenshare Error: ', error);
}
```

You can find `app group` and `extension` name in Xcode under `Signing and Capabilities` section under `target > yourExtensionName`.

![Parameter](/docs/v2/RNParameter.png)


## Stop Screenshare

To stop screen share, application needs to call the `stopScreenshare` method of `HMSSDK` instance.

```js
try {
  await hmsInstance.stopScreenshare();
  console.log('Stop Screenshare Success');
} catch(error) {
  console.log('Stop Screenshare Error: ', error);
}
```


## How to get Screen Share Status

Application needs to call the `isScreenShared` method of `HMSSDK` instance. This method returns `true` inscase Screenshare is currently active and being used, and `false` for inactive state.

```js
try {
  await hmsInstance.isScreenShared();
  console.log('Is Screenshare Success');
} catch(error) {
  console.log('Is Screenshare Error: ', error);
}
```


## Render Screenshare Track

You can get screenshare track in two ways:

- from `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_TRACK_UPDATE` event, when the track is added
- from peers' `auxiliaryTracks` property


Code snippet to get screenshare track from `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_TRACK_UPDATE` event -

```js
const [peerTrackNodes, setPeerTrackNodes] = useState([]);

// Get screenshare track from onTrackListener
const onTrackListener = ({
  peer,
  track,
  type,
}: {
  peer: HMSPeer;
  track: HMSTrack;
  type: HMSTrackUpdate;
}) => {
  if(
    type === HMSTrackUpdate.TRACK_ADDED && // track is added 
    track.source === HMSTrackSource.SCREEN && // track source is screenshare
    track.type === HMSTrackType.VIDEO // track type is video
  ) {
    // Saving screenshare track and peer to render it
    setPeerTrackNodes(prevNodes => {
      return [
        { id: peer.peerID + track.trackId, peer, track, },
        ...prevNodes
      ];
    });
  }
};

...

const HmsView = hmsInstance.HmsView;

<HmsView trackId={peerTrackNodes[0]?.trackId} />
```

Code snippet to get screenshare track from peers' `auxiliaryTracks` property -

```js
const remotePeers = await hmsInstance.getRemotePeers();

const firstPeer = remotePeers[0];

// Get screenshare track from peer
const firstPeerScreenshareTrack = firstPeer.auxiliaryTracks.find(auxiliaryTrack => {
  return (
    auxiliaryTrack.source === HMSTrackSource.SCREEN && // track source is screenshare
      auxiliaryTrack.type === HMSTrackType.VIDEO // track type is video
  );
});

...

const HmsView = hmsInstance?.HmsView;

<HmsView trackId={firstPeerScreenshareTrack?.trackId} />
```

Refer to [Render Video](./render-video) docs to know more about `HmsView` component and help in rendering video.
