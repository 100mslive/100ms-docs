100ms React Native Package provides support for sharing the entire screen of the device to the room.

Please note that for a peer to share their screen, their role must have screenshare enabled in the dashboard. Also select the appropriate resolution for the Screen share quality. 1080p is recommended for better text readability.

## Android Setup

Add `HmsScreenshareActivity` to manifest located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` as follows -

```xml
<application
  android:name=".MainApplication"
  ...
  android:label="@string/app_name">

  ...
  <!-- Add below activity in your "application" tag -->
  <activity
    android:name="com.reactnativehmssdk.HmsScreenshareActivity"
    android:label="@string/app_name" />
  ...

</application>
```

## iOS Setup

You need to create an iOS broadcast upload extension. It uses Apple's ReplayKit framework to record the device screen and delivers frame samples to your broadcast extension. You can share not only your own app but also the entire device sceeen including other apps on the device.

<div className="steps-container">

### Step 1 - Open Xcode project at the `/ios` path of your app
Open your iOS Xcode project `xed ios`.

### Step 2 - Add Broadcast Upload Extension
Click on your project in the Project Navigator to show the project settings. 
Press + at the bottom of the target list to add a new target.

![AddExtension](/docs/v2/RNAddExtension.png)

Select the `Broadcast Upload Extension` type for your new target.

![SelectExtension](/docs/v2/RNSelectExtension.png)

Enter your new target detail in the dialog.
Uncheck Include UI Extension option.

![DetailExtension](/docs/v2/RNDetailExtension.png)

In the following dialog, activate the new scheme for the new target.

![ActivateExtension](/docs/v2/RNActivateExtension.png)

### Step 3 - Add App Group

Click + icon in `Signing & Capabilities` section.
Select `App Group` from the list of Capabilities.

![AddAppgroup](/docs/v2/RNSelectAppGroup.png)

New section should be added under `Signing & Capabilities` named App Groups. Click + icon under that.

![Appgroup](/docs/v2/RNAddAppGroup.png)

Enter App Aroup name. This must be unique to your Apple Development Account. The standard practice is to use your domain name like `group.your.domain.name`.

![AppgroupDetail](/docs/v2/RNAddAppGroupName.png)

### Step 4 - Edit Podfile
In ios folder of your react project and open `Podfile`.
Paste the following code and replace the extension name you just created:

```ruby
# ENSURE TO SET THE CORRECT SCREENSHARE EXTENSION TARGET NAME BELOW
target 'RNHMSExampleBroadcastUpload' do
  use_modular_headers!
  pod 'HMSBroadcastExtensionSDK'
end
```

A sample of complete Podfile snippet after adding the Screenshare Target is as follows -

```ruby
require_relative '../node_modules/react-native/scripts/react_native_pods'
require_relative '../node_modules/@react-native-community/cli-platform-ios/native_modules'

platform :ios, '13.0'

# ENSURE TO SET THE CORRECT iOS SCREENSHARE EXTENSION TARGET NAME BELOW.
# Not required if starting Screenshare from iOS devices is not a feature of the app. Then Remove this Target snippet
target 'RNHMSExampleBroadcastUpload' do
  use_modular_headers!
  pod 'HMSBroadcastExtensionSDK'
end

# ENSURE TO SET THE CORRECT MAIN APP TARGET NAME BELOW
target 'RNHMSExample' do
  config = use_native_modules!
  permissions_path = '../node_modules/react-native-permissions/ios'

  use_react_native!(
    :path => config[:reactNativePath],
    # to enable hermes on iOS, change `false` to `true` and then install pods
    # :hermes_enabled => false
    :hermes_enabled => true
  )

  pod 'Permission-Camera', :path => "#{permissions_path}/Camera"
  pod 'Permission-Microphone', :path => "#{permissions_path}/Microphone"

  target 'RNHMSExampleTests' do
    inherit! :complete
    # Pods for testing
  end

  # Enables Flipper.
  #
  # Note that if you have use_frameworks! enabled, Flipper will not work and
  # you should disable the next line.
  use_flipper!()

  # POST INSTALL SCRIPT TO DISABLE BITCODE FROM ALL PODS & EXCLUDE arm64 FROM SIMULATORS
  post_install do |installer|
    react_native_post_install(installer)
    installer.pods_project.build_configurations.each do |config|
      config.build_settings["EXCLUDED_ARCHS[sdk=iphonesimulator*]"] = "arm64"
      config.build_settings['ENABLE_BITCODE'] = 'NO'
    end
  end
end
```


![Podfile](/docs/v2/RNPodfile.png)

In Terminal, change the directory to `ios` and run `pod install` command.

### Step 5 - Edit SampleHandler
Expand `Runner > ExtensionName` and open SampleHandler file.

![SampleHandler](/docs/v2/RNSampleHandler.png)

Replace the default `SampleHandler.swift` file with the code below and pset the correct App Group created for your Apple Developer Account.

```swift
import ReplayKit
import HMSBroadcastExtensionSDK

class SampleHandler: RPBroadcastSampleHandler {
  
  // ENSURE TO SET CORRECT APP GROUP LINKED TO YOUR APPLE DEVELOPER ACCOUNT HERE
  let screenRenderer = HMSScreenRenderer(appGroup: "group.reactnativehms")
  
  override func broadcastStarted(withSetupInfo setupInfo: [String: NSObject]?) {
  }
  
  override func broadcastPaused() {
  }
  
  override func broadcastResumed() {
  }
  
  override func broadcastFinished() {
    screenRenderer.invalidate()
  }
  
  override func processSampleBuffer(_ sampleBuffer: CMSampleBuffer, with sampleBufferType: RPSampleBufferType) {
    switch sampleBufferType {
    case RPSampleBufferType.video:
      // Handle video sample buffer
      if let error = screenRenderer.process(sampleBuffer) {
        if error.code == .noActiveMeeting {
          finishBroadcastWithError(NSError(domain: "ScreenShare",
                                           code: error.code.rawValue,
                                           userInfo: [NSLocalizedFailureReasonErrorKey: "You are not in a meeting."]))
        }
      }
      break
    case RPSampleBufferType.audioApp:
      _ = self.screenRenderer.process(audioSampleBuffer: sampleBuffer)
      break
    case RPSampleBufferType.audioMic:
      // Handle audio sample buffer for mic audio
      break
    @unknown default:
      // Handle other sample buffer types
      fatalError("Unknown type of sample buffer")
    }
  }
}
```

</div>


## Start Screenshare

To start screen share, app needs to call the `startScreenshare` method of `HMSSDK` instance.

To start screen share in iOS you need to pass App Group and Preferred Extension name while creating HMSSDK instance as follows:

```js
// Create `HMSSDK` instance with `appGroup` and `preferredExtension` properties
const hmsInstance = await HMSSDK.build({
    appGroup: 'group.reactnativehms', // ensure to pass the correct App Group linked to your Apple Developer Account
    preferredExtension: 'RHHMSExampleBroadcastUpload', // ensure to pass the correct Extension Target name created in Xcode
});

...

// Start Screenshare
try {
  await hmsInstance.startScreenshare();
  console.log('Start startScreenshare Success');
} catch(error) {
  console.log('Start startScreenshare Error: ', error);
}
```

You can find `app group` and `extension` name in Xcode under `Signing and Capabilities` section under `target > yourExtensionName`.

![Parameter](/docs/v2/RNParameter.png)


## Stop Screenshare

To stop screen share, application needs to call the `stopScreenshare` method of `HMSSDK` instance.

```js
try {
  await hmsInstance.stopScreenshare();
  console.log('Stop Screenshare Success');
} catch(error) {
  console.log('Stop Screenshare Error: ', error);
}
```


## How to get Screen Share Status

Application needs to call the `isScreenShared` method of `HMSSDK` instance. This method returns `true` inscase Screenshare is currently active and being used, and `false` for inactive state.

```js
try {
  await hmsInstance.isScreenShared();
  console.log('Is Screenshare Success');
} catch(error) {
  console.log('Is Screenshare Error: ', error);
}
```


## Render Screenshare Track

You can get screenshare track in two ways:

- from `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_TRACK_UPDATE` event, when the track is added
- from peers' `auxiliaryTracks` property

> Note: Screenshare track can be differentiated from normal track using tracks' `source` property - `track.source === "SCREEN"` for screenshare tracks

Code snippet to get screenshare track from `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_TRACK_UPDATE` event -

```js
const [peerTrackNodes, setPeerTrackNodes] = useState([]);

// Get screenshare track from onTrackListener
const onTrackListener = ({
  peer,
  track,
  type,
}: {
  peer: HMSPeer;
  track: HMSTrack;
  type: HMSTrackUpdate;
}) => {
  if(
    type === HMSTrackUpdate.TRACK_ADDED && // track is added 
    track.source === HMSTrackSource.SCREEN && // track source is screenshare
    track.type === HMSTrackType.VIDEO // track type is video
  ) {
    // Saving screenshare track and peer to render it
    setPeerTrackNodes(prevNodes => {
      return [
        { id: peer.peerID + track.trackId, peer, track, },
        ...prevNodes
      ];
    });
  }
};

...

const HmsView = hmsInstance.HmsView;

<HmsView trackId={peerTrackNodes[0]?.trackId} />
```

Code snippet to get screenshare track from peers' `auxiliaryTracks` property -

```js
const remotePeers = await hmsInstance.getRemotePeers();

const firstPeer = remotePeers[0];

// Get screenshare track from peer
const firstPeerScreenshareTrack = firstPeer.auxiliaryTracks.find(auxiliaryTrack => {
  return (
    auxiliaryTrack.source === HMSTrackSource.SCREEN && // track source is screenshare
      auxiliaryTrack.type === HMSTrackType.VIDEO // track type is video
  );
});

...

const HmsView = hmsInstance?.HmsView;

<HmsView trackId={firstPeerScreenshareTrack?.trackId} />
```

Refer to [Render Video](./render-video) docs to know more about `HmsView` component and help in rendering video.


## Troubleshooting Guide

For starting Screenshare from iOS devices (iPhones or iPads) following are some common setup you should already have within your Apps -

- `Bitcode` Disabled: Bitcode has been disabled by Apple from Xcode 14 & iOS 16 and above. So 100ms packages also have Disabled Bitcode to ensure compatibility. Ensure that in your Xcode project Bitcode is Disabled for all Targets.

![Disable Bitcode in Xcode](/docs/v2/RNDisableBitcode.png)


- `Podfile` with `Bitcode` Disabled: You can use the following Podfile which has `post_install` script to Disable Bitcode for all `Pods`. Ensure that you modify the `target` for your Main App and the Broadcast Upload Extension. 

In this sample Podfile, the Target names are `Runner` and `FlutterBroadcastUploadExtension`. Change these to the actual Target names defined in your Xcode project.

```ruby
require_relative '../node_modules/react-native/scripts/react_native_pods'
require_relative '../node_modules/@react-native-community/cli-platform-ios/native_modules'

platform :ios, '13.0'

# ENSURE TO SET THE CORRECT iOS SCREENSHARE EXTENSION TARGET NAME BELOW.
# Not required if starting Screenshare from iOS devices is not a feature of the app. Then Remove this Target snippet
target 'RNHMSExampleBroadcastUpload' do
  use_modular_headers!
  pod 'HMSBroadcastExtensionSDK'
end

# ENSURE TO SET THE CORRECT MAIN APP TARGET NAME BELOW
target 'RNHMSExample' do
  config = use_native_modules!
  permissions_path = '../node_modules/react-native-permissions/ios'

  use_react_native!(
    :path => config[:reactNativePath],
    # to enable hermes on iOS, change `false` to `true` and then install pods
    # :hermes_enabled => false
    :hermes_enabled => true
  )

  pod 'Permission-Camera', :path => "#{permissions_path}/Camera"
  pod 'Permission-Microphone', :path => "#{permissions_path}/Microphone"

  target 'RNHMSExampleTests' do
    inherit! :complete
    # Pods for testing
  end

  # Enables Flipper.
  #
  # Note that if you have use_frameworks! enabled, Flipper will not work and
  # you should disable the next line.
  use_flipper!()

  # POST INSTALL SCRIPT TO DISABLE BITCODE FROM ALL PODS & EXCLUDE arm64 FROM SIMULATORS
  post_install do |installer|
    react_native_post_install(installer)
    installer.pods_project.build_configurations.each do |config|
      config.build_settings["EXCLUDED_ARCHS[sdk=iphonesimulator*]"] = "arm64"
      config.build_settings['ENABLE_BITCODE'] = 'NO'
    end
  end
end
```


- `Background Modes` Enabled: In majority use-cases, playing audio from Room would be required when app is in Background Mode. Mostly, if users are starting Screenshare from their iPhones/iPads they would want to continue listening to audio from the Room. So, ensure that you have Background Modes Enabled in your Xcode project.

![Enable Background Modes](/docs/v2/rn-background-modes.png)


- Running on Simulator: Starting Screenshare from an iOS Simulator is not supported by Apple. You can start Screenshare only from an actual iOS device like an iPhone or iPad.


- iOS Deployment Target Version: 100ms Flutter Package is supported for iOS 12 and above versions. Ensure that the Minimum iOS Deployment Target Version is set to `12.0` or above in your Xcode project & the Podfile.



- Role has Screenshare Permission: Ensure that the [Role](../foundation/templates-and-roles) used to Join the Room has Screenshare permission Enabled from the [100ms Dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/). If the Screenshare permission is not Enabled from the Dashboard, any users joining with this Role won't be able to start Screenshare. These users would still be able to see Screenshare performed by other Peers who have Screenshare permissions.
