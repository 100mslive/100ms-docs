Android provides support for sharing the entire screen of the device to the room. Please note that for a peer to share their screen, 
their role must have screenshare enabled in the dashboard. Also select the appropriate resolution that you desire the screenshare track should be of.

## Adding activity to AndroidManifest.xml
Add `HmsScreenshareActivity` to manifest located at `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
```js
<activity
  android:name="com.reactnativehmssdk.HmsScreenshareActivity"
  android:label="@string/app_name" />
```

## How to start screenshare from the app
To start screen share, app needs to call the `startScreenshare` method of `HMSSDK`.
Following is the snippet on how to use this:
```js
// hms instance acquired from build method
await hmsInstance?.startScreenshare()
    .then(d => console.log('Start startScreenshare Success: ', d))
    .catch(e => console.log('Start startScreenshare Error: ', e));
```
## How to stop screenshare from the app
To start screen share, application needs to call the `stopScreenshare` method of `HMSSDK`.
Following is the snippet on how to use this:
```js
// hms instance acquired from build method
await hmsInstance?.stopScreenshare()
    .then(d => console.log('Stop Screenshare Success: ', d))
    .catch(e => console.log('Stop Screenshare Error: ', e));
```
## How to get Screen Share Status
Application needs to call the `isScreenShared` method of `HMSSDK`. This method returns a Boolean which will be true 
inscase ScreenShare is currently active and being used, and False for inactive state.
```js
// hms instance acquired from build method
await hmsInstance?.isScreenShared()
    .then(d => console.log('Is Screenshare Success: ', d))
    .catch(e => console.log('Is Screenshare Error: ', e));
```

## How to display screenshare tracks
The peer's video is in `peer.videoTrack` and their ScreenShare video is in the `peer.auxiliaryTracks` which is of type `HMSTrack[]`.

```js
const HmsView = hmsInstance?.HmsView;
const peerTrackNodes = [];

// Get screenshare track from onTrackListener
const onTrackListener = ({
  peer,
  track,
  type,
}: {
  peer: HMSPeer;
  track: HMSTrack;
  type: HMSTrackUpdate;
}) => {
  if(type === HMSTrackUpdate.TRACK_ADDED && track.source === HMSTrackSource.SCREEN && track.type === HMSTrackType.VIDEO){
    peerTrackNodes.push({
      id: peer.peerID + track.trackId,
      peer,
      track,
    })
  }
};

// Get screenshare track from peer
const auxiliaryTracks = hmsInstance?.remotePeers[0]?.auxiliaryTracks

auxiliaryTracks?.map(track => {
  if(track.source === HMSTrackSource.SCREEN && track.type === HMSTrackType.VIDEO){
    peerTrackNodes.push({
      id: peer.peerID + track.trackId,
      peer,
      track,
    })
  }
});

<HmsView trackId={peerTrackNodes[0]?.trackId} />
```
