title: Capture HmsView
nav: 3.999
---

The React Native SDK provides a Component `HmsView` that renders the video on screen. To capture the frame from the video we can pass `screenshot` prop 
as true to this component. This would capture the frame of that HmsView and save it in your gallery. Don't forget to give `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` 
permission before capturing the surface and saving. It is a android only feature.

```js
import React from 'react';
import { HMSVideoViewMode } from '@100mslive/react-native-hms';
...
// hms instance acquired from build method
const HmsView = hmsInstance.HmsView;
const hmsViewRef: any = React.useRef()

const onPress: async () => {
  const granted = await requestExternalStoragePermission();
  if (granted) {
    hmsViewRef?.current?.capture()
      .then((base64: string) => {
        // we get a base64 string
      });
      .catch((error: any) => console.log(error));
  }
},

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  hmsView: {
    height: '100%',
    width: '100%',
  },
});

<HmsView
  ref={hmsViewRef}
  trackId={trackId} 
  scaleType={HMSVideoViewMode.ASPECT_FILL} 
  style={styles.hmsView} 
  mirror={true} 
  sink={true} />
...
```
