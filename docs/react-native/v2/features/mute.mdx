Mute is something that applies to both audio and video. When you mute audio, you can't be heard by other people i.e your audio is OFF. When you mute a video, you will not be broadcasting your video to other people i.e your video is OFF.


## Check Mute Status

Current Mute Status of any `HMSTrack` can be checked by calling `isMute` method on it.

In most of the cases, You would need current mute status to toggle mute and render correct mic and camera icons.

```js
// You can get `HMSTrack` object from `HMSPeer` object
// or `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_TRACK_UPDATE` event

const audioMuted = peer.audioTrack?.isMute(); // audioTrack property can be undefined

const videoMuted = peer.videoTrack?.isMute(); // videoTrack property can be undefined
```


## Change Your(Local Peer) Mute Status

To switch your "video" or "audio" on/off, you can call `setMute` method available on `HMSLocalVideoTrack` or `HMSLocalAudioTrack` objects respectively with `true` or `false` values.

If you want to toggle mute status of your "video" or "audio", then you can first get the current mute status and then pass opposite value to `setMute` method.

```js
// instance acquired from build() method
const localPeer = await hmsInstance.getLocalPeer();

// Muting Example - 

localPeer.localAudioTrack().setMute(true); // Muting Local Audio

localPeer.localVideoTrack().setMute(true); // Muting Local Video


// Toggling Mute Example -

const audioMuted = localPeer.audioTrack?.isMute();

// Toggling Local Audio, audio will be unmuted
localPeer.localAudioTrack().setMute(!audioMuted); // passing opposite value of audioMuted

const videoMuted = localPeer.videoTrack?.isMute();

// Toggling Local Video, video will be unmuted
localPeer.localVideoTrack().setMute(!videoMuted); // passing opposite value of videoMuted
```
