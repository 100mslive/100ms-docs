title: Leave Room
nav: 3.2

Once you're done with the meeting and want to exit, call leave on the HMSSDK instance you created to join the room.

Before calling leave, remove the previously added Event Listeners (HMSUpdateListenerActions) as -

```js
// Removing all registered event listeners
hmsInstance.removeAllListeners();
```

To leave the meeting, call the `leave` method of `HMSSDK` instance. `leave` method returns `promise` which is resolved upon completion of leave process.

```js
try {
  await hmsInstance.leave();
  console.log('Leave Success');
} catch (error) {
  console.log('Leave Error: ', error);
}
```

After leaving the meeting, you can free your apps' resources if you don't need the `HMSSDK` instance anymore, check out [Release Resources Docs](https://www.100ms.live/docs/react-native/v2/features/release-resources)
