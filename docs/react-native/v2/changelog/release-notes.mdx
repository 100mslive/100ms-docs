## 1.7.0 - 2023-06-21

### Breaking

- On Android, in the `build.gradle` file, increasing the `compileSdkVersion` & `targetSdkVersion` to `33` is required. For the changes in `build.gradle` file, refer [here](https://github.com/100mslive/react-native-hms/pull/1064/files#diff-ed8534ece8080a880075e103269eb1b9bdff22e8dfcf8427d7d977603292b889).

### Fixed
- Corrected the path of SDK Versions JSON file used in Gradle & Podspec files



## 1.1.0 - 2022-12-16

### Added

- Added support for Bulk Role Change

  Bulk Role Change is used when you want to convert all Roles from a list of Roles, to another Role.

  For example, if peers join a room with a _Waiting_ Role and now you want to change all these peers to _Viewer_ Role then use the `changeRoleOfPeersWithRoles` API.

  ```js
  // fetch all available Roles in the room
  const roles = await hmsInstance.getRoles();

  // get the Host Role object
  const hostRole = roles.find(role => role.name === 'host');

  // get list of Roles to be updated - in this case "Waiting" and "Guest" Roles
  const rolesToChange = roles.filter(role => role.name === 'waiting' || role.name === 'guest');

  // now perform Role Change of all peers in "Waiting" and "Guest" Roles to the "Host" Role
  await hmsInstance.changeRoleOfPeersWithRoles(rolesToChange, hostRole);
  ```
  For More Information, refer: https://www.100ms.live/docs/react-native/v2/features/change-role


- Added HMSPIPConfig to enable buttons on PIP Window on Android

  Actionable buttons like Mute/Unmute Audio/Video, Leave Room for local peers can now be configured while enabling PIP Mode.
  ```js
  await hmsInstance?.enablePipMode({
          aspectRatio: [16, 9],   // for 16:9 aspect ratio
          endButton: true,   
          videoButton: true,  
          audioButton: true,
        });
  ```
  For More Information, refer: https://www.100ms.live/docs/react-native/v2/advanced-features/pip-mode


### Deprecated

  No change in functionality or method signature.


### Fixed

- Corrected Speaker updates by avoiding sending of update event if a peer is not found in room on Android
- Microphone not getting captured on Role Change from a non-publishing to publishing Role on iOS
- Corrected an issue where on iOS a default Audio Mixer was getting created if Track Settings was passed while building the HMSSDK instance


Updated to Native Android SDK 2.5.4 & Native iOS SDK 0.5.3

Full Changelog: [1.0.0...1.1.0](https://github.com/100mslive/react-native-hms/compare/1.0.0...1.1.0)



## 1.0.0 - 2022-12-01

#### Added
- Added support for Picture in Picture mode on Android.

    PIP Mode lets the user watch the room video in a small window pinned to a corner of the screen while navigating between apps or browsing content on the main screen.

    Example implementation for checking device support & enabling PIP mode:
    
    ```js
    const isPIPSupported = await hmsInstance.isPipModeSupported();

    const isEnabled = await hmsInstance.enablePipMode();
    ```
    
- Added Session Metadata APIs.

    Session metadata is a shared state that is accessible by everyone in the room. 
    
    Session metadata can be used to achieve features like pinned text, spotlight(bringing a particular peer into a larger stage), etc.
    
    Example usage of setting & getting Room's Session Metadata:
    
    ```js
    // set session metadata for the room
    hmsInstance.setSessionMetaData(value).then(() => {

      // on success, you can send a message to all the peers to fetch metadata
      hmsInstance.sendBroadcastMessage('refresh', HMSMessageType.METADATA);
    });

    // peers in the room can fetch current Session Metadata any time using `getSessionMetaData` method
    const metadata = await hmsInstance.getSessionMetaData();
    ```

- Added accessing of the local peer from the `HMSRoom` instance
    ```js
    // you can now directly access local peer from HMSRoom object returned in `ON_JOIN` event listener
    const onJoinSuccess = (data: {room: HMSRoom}) => {
        console.log('local peer: ', data.room.localPeer);
