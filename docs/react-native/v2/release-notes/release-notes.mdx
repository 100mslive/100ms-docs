    HMSVideoView on Android provides a better abstraction to render live video and handles edge cases like managing Release/Init states. It has in-built support to subscribe to video of the correct resolution.

    To learn more about Rendering Video, refer the guide [here](https://www.100ms.live/docs/react-native/v2/how--to-guides/set-up-video-conferencing/render-video/overview).

-   Added Simulcast support for RTC Stats

    RTC Call Stats are updated to show Simulcast layer data if available for Local Peer's Video Track. This can be used to diagnose user experience with metrics such as Audio/Video Bitrate, Round Trip Time, Packet loss, etc.

    To learn more about using RTC Call Stats, refer the guide [here](https://www.100ms.live/docs/react-native/v2/how--to-guides/measure-network-quality-and-performance/rtc-stats).

Our latest release comes with major performance enhancements which include -

-   The introduction of Room and Peer Stores internally to optimize the initial data transfer across the JS Bridge.

-   Enhanced Disconnected State detection on specific networks for better stability.

Updated to Native Android SDK 2.5.7 & Native iOS SDK 0.6.4

Full Changelog: [1.1.1...1.2.0](https://github.com/100mslive/react-native-hms/compare/1.1.1...1.2.0)

## 1.1.1 - 2022-12-22

### Fixed

-   Corrected the path of SDK Versions JSON file used in Gradle & Podspec files

## 1.1.0 - 2022-12-16

### Added

-   Added support for Bulk Role Change

    Bulk Role Change is used when you want to convert all Roles from a list of Roles, to another Role.

    For example, if peers join a room with a _Waiting_ Role and now you want to change all these peers to _Viewer_ Role then use the `changeRoleOfPeersWithRoles` API.

    ```js
    // fetch all available Roles in the room
    const roles = await hmsInstance.getRoles();

    // get the Host Role object
    const hostRole = roles.find((role) => role.name === 'host');

    // get list of Roles to be updated - in this case "Waiting" and "Guest" Roles
    const rolesToChange = roles.filter((role) => role.name === 'waiting' || role.name === 'guest');

    // now perform Role Change of all peers in "Waiting" and "Guest" Roles to the "Host" Role
    await hmsInstance.changeRoleOfPeersWithRoles(rolesToChange, hostRole);
    ```

    For More Information, refer: https://www.100ms.live/docs/react-native/v2/features/change-role

-   Added HMSPIPConfig to enable buttons on PIP Window on Android

    Actionable buttons like Mute/Unmute Audio/Video, Leave Room for local peers can now be configured while enabling PIP Mode.

    ```js
    await hmsInstance?.enablePipMode({
        aspectRatio: [16, 9], // for 16:9 aspect ratio
        endButton: true,
        videoButton: true,
        audioButton: true
    });
    ```

    For More Information, refer: https://www.100ms.live/docs/react-native/v2/advanced-features/pip-mode

### Deprecated

-   Deprecated `changeRole` API in favour of `changeRoleOfPeer`

    No change in functionality or method signature.

### Fixed

-   Corrected Speaker updates by avoiding sending of update event if a peer is not found in room on Android
-   Microphone not getting captured on Role Change from a non-publishing to publishing Role on iOS
-   Corrected an issue where on iOS a default Audio Mixer was getting created if Track Settings was passed while building the HMSSDK instance

Updated to Native Android SDK 2.5.4 & Native iOS SDK 0.5.3

Full Changelog: [1.0.0...1.1.0](https://github.com/100mslive/react-native-hms/compare/1.0.0...1.1.0)

## 1.0.0 - 2022-12-01

#### Added

-   Added support for Picture in Picture mode on Android.

    PIP Mode lets the user watch the room video in a small window pinned to a corner of the screen while navigating between apps or browsing content on the main screen.

    Example implementation for checking device support & enabling PIP mode:

    ```js
    const isPIPSupported = await hmsInstance.isPipModeSupported();

    const isEnabled = await hmsInstance.enablePipMode();
    ```

-   Added Session Metadata APIs.

    Session metadata is a shared state that is accessible by everyone in the room.

    Session metadata can be used to achieve features like pinned text, spotlight(bringing a particular peer into a larger stage), etc.

    Example usage of setting & getting Room's Session Metadata:

    ```js
    // set session metadata for the room
    hmsInstance.setSessionMetaData(value).then(() => {
        // on success, you can send a message to all the peers to fetch metadata
        hmsInstance.sendBroadcastMessage('refresh', HMSMessageType.METADATA);
    });

    // peers in the room can fetch current Session Metadata any time using `getSessionMetaData` method
    const metadata = await hmsInstance.getSessionMetaData();
    ```

-   Added accessing of the local peer from the `HMSRoom` instance

    ```js
    // you can now directly access local peer from HMSRoom object returned in `ON_JOIN` event listener
    const onJoinSuccess = (data: {room: HMSRoom}) => {
        console.log('local peer: ', data.room.localPeer);
    };
    ```

-   Added `HMSMessageType` enum to Message
