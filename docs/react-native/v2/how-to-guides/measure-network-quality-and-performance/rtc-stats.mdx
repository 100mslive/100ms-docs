title: RTC Call Stats
nav: 12.2
---

Sometimes you need a way to capture certain metrics related to a call. This may be helpful
if you want to tailor the experience to your users or debug issues. Typical metrics of interest
are audio/video bitrate, round trip time, total consumed bandwidth and packet loss.

100ms SDK provides this data via certain events. These events are
emitted continuously within a fixed interval of one second after a room has been joined. You can get stats:

-   as an overall summary by subscribing to `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_RTC_STATS` event, or
-   on a per track basis by subscribing to
    -   `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_LOCAL_AUDIO_STATS` event for local audio stats,
    -   `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_LOCAL_VIDEO_STATS` event for local video stats,
    -   `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_REMOTE_AUDIO_STATS` event for remote peers' audio stats,
    -   `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_REMOTE_VIDEO_STATS` event for remote peers' video stats

> To get a list of all events emitted by the 100ms React Native SDK, check out [Event Listener guide](/react-native/v2/how--to-guides/listen-to-room-updates/event-listeners)

Let's see how we can get Stats by subscribing to above events -

### Subscribe to Events

You can subscribe to stats events as per your use case:

-   `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_RTC_STATS`: This event provides combined stats for the Room session.
-   `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_LOCAL_AUDIO_STATS`: This event provides stats for local audio track.
-   `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_LOCAL_VIDEO_STATS`: This event provides stats for local video track with all the available layers.
-   `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_REMOTE_AUDIO_STATS`: This event provides stats for remote peers' audio tracks.
-   `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_REMOTE_VIDEO_STATS`: This event provides stats for remote peers' video tracks.

```js
const onChangeRtcStats = (data: {
    rtcStats: HMSRTCStatsReport // `HMSRTCStatsReport` is explained in 'Supplementary bytes' section
}) => {
    console.log(data.rtcStats);
};

hmsInstance.addEventListener(HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_RTC_STATS, onChangeRtcStats);

// This function is subscribed to `ON_LOCAL_AUDIO_STATS` event
const onChangeLocalAudioStats = (data: {
    localAudioStats: HMSLocalAudioStats, // `HMSLocalAudioStats` is explained in 'Supplementary bytes' section
    track: HMSLocalAudioTrack,
    peer: HMSPeer
}) => {
    console.log(data.localAudioStats);
};

hmsInstance.addEventListener(
    HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_LOCAL_AUDIO_STATS,
    onChangeLocalAudioStats
);

// This function is subscribed to `ON_LOCAL_VIDEO_STATS` event
const onChangeLocalVideoStats = (data: {
    localVideoStats: HMSLocalVideoStats, // `HMSLocalVideoStats` is explained in 'Supplementary bytes' section
    track: HMSLocalVideoTrack,
    peer: HMSPeer
}) => {
    console.log(data.localVideoStats);
};

hmsInstance.addEventListener(
    HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_LOCAL_VIDEO_STATS,
    onChangeLocalVideoStats
);

// This function is subscribed to `ON_REMOTE_AUDIO_STATS` event
const onChangeRemoteAudioStats = (data: {
    remoteAudioStats: HMSRemoteAudioStats, // `HMSRemoteAudioStats` is explained in 'Supplementary bytes' section
    track: HMSRemoteAudioTrack,
    peer: HMSPeer
}) => {
    console.log(data.remoteAudioStats);
};

hmsInstance.addEventListener(
    HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_REMOTE_AUDIO_STATS,
    onChangeRemoteAudioStats
);

// This function is subscribed to `ON_REMOTE_VIDEO_STATS` event
const onChangeRemoteVideoStats = (data: {
    remoteVideoStats: HMSRemoteVideoStats, // `HMSRemoteVideoStats` is explained in 'Supplementary bytes' section
    track: HMSRemoteVideoTrack,
    peer: HMSPeer
}) => {
    console.log(data.remoteVideoStats);
};

hmsInstance.addEventListener(
    HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_REMOTE_VIDEO_STATS,
    onChangeRemoteVideoStats
);
```

### Unsubscribe from Events

You can remove your event subscriptions after you are done with these stats and don't want to receive these event updates anymore -

```js
hmsInstance.removeEventListener(HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_RTC_STATS);

hmsInstance.removeEventListener(HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_LOCAL_AUDIO_STATS);

hmsInstance.removeEventListener(HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_LOCAL_VIDEO_STATS);

hmsInstance.removeEventListener(HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_REMOTE_AUDIO_STATS);

hmsInstance.removeEventListener(HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_REMOTE_VIDEO_STATS);
```
