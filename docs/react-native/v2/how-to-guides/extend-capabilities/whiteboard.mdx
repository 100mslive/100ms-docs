## Introduction

The 100ms SDK provides robust APIs for integrating whiteboard collaboration into your conferencing sessions.
 Participants can engage in real-time by drawing, writing, and collaborating on a shared digital whiteboard.

This documentation outlines how to implement the start and stop functionality for a whiteboard and display it within a "WebView".


## Minimum Requirements

- Minimum React Native HMSSDK version - `@100mslive/react-native-hms@^1.10.5`
- Whiteboard is enabled for the room via the 100ms dashboard
- User roles must be configured to enable whiteboard functionality via the 100ms dashboard for starting or viewing the whiteboard.


## Displaying the Shared Whiteboard

To display the shared whiteboard into your application, subscribe to whiteboard updates using the `addWhiteboardUpdateListener` method
 available on the interactivity center of HMSSDK (`hmsInstance.interactivityCenter`) -

```js
useEffect(() => {
  // Add listener for whiteboard updates
  const subscription =
    hmsInstance.interactivityCenter.addWhiteboardUpdateListener(
      (hmsWhiteboard, updateType) => {
        if (updateType === HMSWhiteboardUpdateType.STARTED) {
            // Whiteboard started, Use webview to show Whiteboard
            // you can use `hmsWhiteboard` variable to get info about the started whiteboard
            //  like accessing url of the whiteboard - `hmsWhiteboard.url`
        }
        if (updateType === HMSWhiteboardUpdateType.STOPPED) {
            // Whiteboard stopped
            // Unmount Webview or let the user know that whiteboard has stopped
        }
      }
    );

  // Removing whiteboard updates listener
  return () => subscription.remove();
}, [hmsInstance]);
```

function passed to `addWhiteboardUpdateListener` method will be invoked with -

- `whiteboard object` as first argument, whiteboard object has the following interface -
  ```js
  interface HMSWhiteboard {
    id: string; // A unique identifier for the whiteboard session.
    title?: string; // The title or name of the whiteboard session
    owner?: HMSPeer; // HMSPeer object of the peer who started the whiteboard
    url?: string; // URL to load whiteboard in webview
  }
  ```

- `whiteboard update type` as second argument, update type is an enum -
  ```js
  enum HMSWhiteboardUpdateType {
    STARTED = 'STARTED', // Indicates that the whiteboard has been started.
    STOPPED = 'STOPPED', // Indicates that the whiteboard has been stopped.
  }
  ```

### Render Webview

When whiteboard has started and you have the url of whiteboard, you can use webview from [react-native-webview](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-webview) package as follows -

```js{8-9}
import { WebView } from 'react-native-webview';

...

<WebView
  source={{ uri: hmsWhiteboard.url }}
  style={{ flex: 1 }}
  javaScriptEnabled={true} // Needed for whiteboard to work correctly on android
  domStorageEnabled={true} // Needed for whiteboard to work correctly on android
/>
```

> Note: It's crucial to Unmount the WebView when the whiteboard session is stopped to release resources.


## Starting whiteboard

We can use `startWhiteboard` method available on the interactivity center of HMSSDK (`hmsInstance.interactivityCenter`) -

```js
hmsInstance.interactivityCenter
  .startWhiteboard('Interactive Session')
  .then((success) => {
    console.log('#startWhiteboard started whiteboard ', success);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log('#startWhiteboard error ', error);
  });
```

> Ensure that the role has the appropriate permission and the current whiteboard is not already open.


## Stopping whiteboard

We can use `stopWhiteboard` method available on the interactivity center of HMSSDK (`hmsInstance.interactivityCenter`) to stop currently opened whiteboard -

> Note: Only owner can close the currently opened whiteboard session 

```js
hmsInstance.interactivityCenter
  .stopWhiteboard()
  .then((success) => {
    console.log('#stopWhiteboard stopped whiteboard ', success);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log('#stopWhiteboard error ', error);
  });
```

> Ensure the role has appropriate permission and the current whiteboard session is opened by the user.


## How to know if local peer is allowed to show/hide whiteboard

Every peer has a role assigned. This HMSRole object contains whiteboard permissions in a whiteboard permission object. You can check what whiteboord permissions the current user has like below:

```js
// local peer role
let userRole = localPeer.role;

// whiteboard permissions of local peer
let whiteboardPermissions = userRole.permissions.whiteboard;

let isUserAdmin = whiteboardPermissions.admin; // user can start, stop and view
let canWrite = whiteboardPermissions.write; // user can collaborate and view
let canRead = whiteboardPermissions.read; // user can only view
```


## How to know if local peer started the whiteboard

As stated above, whiteboard object has `owner` property which is an instance of `HMSPeer` class. We can compare local peer's `peerID` with `peerID` of `hmsWhiteboard.owner` -

```js
const whiteboardOwner = hmsWhiteboard.owner; // Nullable HMSPeer

// Checking if local peer is owner of whiteboard
const isUserOwner = localPeer.peerID === whiteboardOwner?.peerID;

// if `isUserOwner` is `true`, means local peer started the whiteboard and can stop it
// if `isUserOwner` is `false`, means someone else started the whiteboard, local peer can't stop it
```
