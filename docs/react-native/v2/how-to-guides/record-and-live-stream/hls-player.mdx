The `HMSHLSPlayer` component is an HLS player offered by 100ms that can be used to play HLS streams.
The player can take a URL to play the stream. It also sends analytics events related to the HLS
playback to the 100ms dashboard. 


## Requirements

- SDK version 1.7.0 or higher


## How to Start HLS

- Take a look at the [HLS Streaming](./hls) docs about how to start HLS stream in a rRoom.

- [Here's](./hls#current-room-status) how to read the HLS URL from the room.

From the above links, we now know that we can get the HLS stream URL from `ON_JOIN` and `ON_ROOM_UPDATE`
events.


## How to Play an HLS Stream

<div className="steps-container">

### Import HMSHLSPlayer component

```js
import { HMSHLSPlayer } from '@100mslive/react-native-hms';
```

### Play HLS Stream on HMSHLSPlayer component

- <strong>Play the HLS Stream as soon as `HMSHLSPlayer` component is visible on screen</strong>

  We can render the `HMSHLSPlayer` component and pass the HLS Stream URL to it to play the HLS stream.

  ```js
  const streamURL = room.hlsStreamingState?.variants?.get(0)?.hlsStreamUrl;

  ...

  <HMSHLSPlayer url={streamURL} />
  ```

  The `url` prop of HMSHLSPlayer component is optional, HMSHLSPlayer can automatically get the HLS
  stream URL from the HMSRoom if you render it when HLS stream has started -

  ```js
  // --- snip ---

  const isHLSStreamRunning = room.hlsStreamingState?.running;

  ...

  if (isHLSStreamRunning) {
    return <HMSHLSPlayer />;
  }

  return <Text>Waiting for strem to start</Text>;
  ```

  Checkout 2nd point of [How to Start HLS](#how-to-start-hls) section to know how to check if HLS Stream
  is running or not.

- <strong>Render `HMSHLSPlayer` component first and Play later</strong>

  We can also call `play` method available on ref of `HMSHLSPlayer` component to play the HLS Stream.
  `play` method accepts the HLS stream URL as a first parameter. However, It's optional, if we don't pass
  it, then `HMSHLSPlayer` component tries to read URL from HMSRoom.

  ```js{12}
  // Create `ref` for `HMSHLSPlayer` component
  const hmsHlsPlayerRef = useRef(null);

  ...

  // Assign above created ref to `ref` prop of `HMSHLSPlayer` component
  <HMSHLSPlayer ref={hmsHlsPlayerRef} />

  ...

  // Now, we can call `play` method on `hmsHlsPlayerRef` anytime
  hmsHlsPlayerRef.current?.play();
  ```

Take a look at [how the sample app does this](#) if not clear.
</div>


## How to Stop the Playback

When the `HMSHLSPlayer` component is unmounted, HLS stream playback is automatically stopped.

If you want to stop the stream playback without unmounting the `HMSHLSPlayer` component, you can call `stop`
method available on the `ref` of `HMSHLSPlayer` component -

```js{12}
// Create `ref` for `HMSHLSPlayer` component
const hmsHlsPlayerRef = useRef(null);

...

// Assign above created ref to `ref` prop of `HMSHLSPlayer` component
<HMSHLSPlayer ref={hmsHlsPlayerRef} />

...

// Now, we can call `stop` method on `hmsHlsPlayerRef`
hmsHlsPlayerRef.current?.stop();
```

## How to Show Video Player UI

By default, Video Player UI or Controls are hidden.

<PortraitImage
    src="/docs/docs/v2/hls-player-ui-without-controls-showcase.png"
    alt="HLS Player Controls UI Showcase"
    width="100%"
    height=""
/>

We can show Video Player UI or Controls by passing `true` to `enableControls` prop on `HMSHLSPlayer` component -

```js{3}
<HMSHLSPlayer
  // Pass `true` to `enableControls` prop to show the Video Player Controls
  enableControls={true} 
/>
```

<PortraitImage
    src="/docs/docs/v2/hls-player-ui-with-controls-showcase.png"
    alt="HLS Player Controls UI Showcase"
    width="100%"
    height=""
/>


## How to Pause and Resume the Playback

We can Pause and/or Resume the HLS Playback using the `pause` and `resume` methods respectively
available on the `ref` of `HMSHLSPlayer` component -

```js{11-12}
// Create `ref` for `HMSHLSPlayer` component
const hmsHlsPlayerRef = useRef(null);

...

// Assign the above created ref to `ref` prop of `HMSHLSPlayer` component
<HMSHLSPlayer ref={hmsHlsPlayerRef} />

...

hmsHlsPlayerRef.current?.pause();
hmsHlsPlayerRef.current?.resume();
```


## How to Seek Forward or Backward

We can seek forward and/or backwards on the HLS Playback using the `seekForward` and `seekBackward` methods respectively
available on the `ref` of `HMSHLSPlayer` component.

`seekForward` and `seekBackward` methods accept number of seconds to seek by as a first parameter.

```js{11-15}
// Create `ref` for `HMSHLSPlayer` component
const hmsHlsPlayerRef = useRef(null);

...

// Assign above created ref to `ref` prop of `HMSHLSPlayer` component
<HMSHLSPlayer ref={hmsHlsPlayerRef} />

...

// Seek Forward by 5 seconds
hmsHlsPlayerRef.current?.seekForward(5);

// Seek Backward by 5 seconds
hmsHlsPlayerRef.current?.seekBackward(5);
```


## How to Seek to Live Position

We can use `seekToLivePosition` method available on the `ref` of `HMSHLSPlayer` component to go to the live position -

```js{12}
// Create `ref` for `HMSHLSPlayer` component
const hmsHlsPlayerRef = useRef(null);

...

// Assign above created ref to `ref` prop of `HMSHLSPlayer` component
<HMSHLSPlayer ref={hmsHlsPlayerRef} />

...

// Go to Live Position on HLS Stream
hmsHlsPlayerRef.current?.seekToLivePosition();
```


## How to Change the Volume of HLS Playback

We can use `setVolume` method available on the `ref` of `HMSHLSPlayer` component to change the playback volume levels.
`setVolume` method accepts volume level as a first parameter, valid volume level is in `[0-100]` range.

> Volume is set to `100` level by default.

```js{12}
// Create `ref` for `HMSHLSPlayer` component
const hmsHlsPlayerRef = useRef(null);

...

// Assign above created ref to `ref` prop of `HMSHLSPlayer` component
<HMSHLSPlayer ref={hmsHlsPlayerRef} />

...

hmsHlsPlayerRef.current?.setVolume(50); // use value from 0-100 range
```


## How to Know the Stats Related to HLS Playback



<div className="steps-container">

### Enable HLS Stats on the `HMSHLSPlayer` component

By default, `HMSHLSPlayer` component does not send playback stats. We can enable HLS Stats on
the `HMSHLSPlayer` component using the `enableStats` prop -

```js{3}
<HMSHLSPlayer
  // Pass `true` to `enableStats` prop to enable the HLS Player Stats
  enableStats={true}
/>
```

### Use HLS Stats received from the `HMSHLSPlayer` component

Now, we can use `useHMSHLSPlayerStats` hook in any component to get the stats object -

```js{9}
// Step 1: Import `useHMSHLSPlayerStats` hook
import { useHMSHLSPlayerStats } from '@100mslive/react-native-hms';

...

// Step 2: use `useHMSHLSPlayerStats` hook inside any Component
const HLSStatsView = () => {

  const { stats, error } = useHMSHLSPlayerStats();
}
```

`stats` object has the following interface -

```js
interface HMSHLSPlayerStatsUpdateEventData {
  // current network speed of the user
  bandWidthEstimate: number;

  // total Bytes downloaded till this moment
  totalBytesLoaded: number;

  // An estimate of the total buffered duration from the current position
  bufferedDuration: number;

  // Distance of current playing position from live edge
  distanceFromLive: number;

  // total number of dropped frames
  droppedFrameCount: number;

  // bitrate of the current layer being played
  averageBitrate: number;

  // The height of the resolution of video
  videoHeight: number;

  // The width of the resolution of video
  videoWidth: number;
};
```
</div>

An example of usage of `useHMSHLSPlayerCue` hook is provided in the sample app in [HLSPlayerStatsView Component](#).


## How to Know When Player Changes State During Playback

The HLS player can be in one of the following states: `playing`, `stopped`, `paused`, `buffering`, `failed`, or `unknown` during playback.

We can use `useHMSHLSPlayerPlaybackState` hook to know about the state change event during the playback -

```js{10}
// Step 1: Import `useHMSHLSPlayerPlaybackState` hook
import { useHMSHLSPlayerPlaybackState } from '@100mslive/react-native-hms';

...

// Step 2: use `useHMSHLSPlayerPlaybackState` hook inside any Component

const HLSView = () => {

  const playbackState = useHMSHLSPlayerPlaybackState();
}
```

HLS Player playback state can be one of variant of `HMSHLSPlayerPlaybackState` enum -

```js
enum HMSHLSPlayerPlaybackState {
  BUFFERING = 'buffering',
  FAILED = 'failed',
  PAUSED = 'paused',
  PLAYING = 'playing',
  STOPPED = 'stopped',
  UNKNOWN = 'unknown',
}
```

### How to Know When There is an Error During HLS Playback

We can use `useHMSHLSPlayerPlaybackError` hook to know about the errors that happen during playback.

`useHMSHLSPlayerPlaybackError` hook usage is just like the usage of [`useEffect` hook](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect).
We pass a callback function to the `useHMSHLSPlayerPlaybackError` hook as a first parameter and dependency array as a second parameter.
Whenever there is an error during playback, passed callback function will be called with error occurred.

```js
useHMSHLSPlayerPlaybackError(
  // callback function
  (err) => {
    // logging playback error to console
    console.log(err);
  },
  // dependency array
  []
);
```

HLS Player Playback Error has the following interface -

```js
interface HLSPlayerPlackbackError {
  errorCode: string;
  errorCodeName: string;
  message?: string;
};
```


## How to Use HLS Timed Metadata with 100ms HLS player

When we use the 100ms HLS player to play the HLS stream, we can use `useHMSHLSPlayerCue` hook to
get timed cue events when the player's current time matches that of a timed event in the HLS stream and use it's data to
show any UI like quizzes, poll etc. to HLS viewers.

`useHMSHLSPlayerCue` hook usage is just like the usage of [`useEffect` hook](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect).
We pass a callback function to the `useHMSHLSPlayerCue` hook as a first parameter and dependency array as a second parameter.
Whenever there is a timed cue event, passed callback function will be called with cue data.

```js
useHMSHLSPlayerCue(
  // callback function
  (cue) => {
    const payloadStr = cue.payloadval;

    if (typeof payloadStr === 'string') {
      // use the cue data payload as per your usecase like quizzes, polls and emoticons etc.
    }
  },
  // dependency array
  []
);
```

HLS Player Cue data has the following interface -

```js
interface HMSHLSPlayerPlaybackCue {
  // Unique id of the timed event
  id?: string;

  // String payload of the timed event
  payloadval?: string;

  // endDate of the timed event
  endDate?: Date;

  // startDate of the timed event
  startDate: Date;
};
```

An example of usage of `useHMSHLSPlayerCue` hook is provided in the sample app in [HLSPlayerEmoticons Component](#).


## How to Configure HLS Player to Send Analytics Events

There is no configuration needed, `HMSHLSPlayer` component automatically sends Analytics Events to 100ms dashboard when the Room is active.
