[HLS Streaming](/react-native/v2/foundation/live-streaming) allows for scaling to millions of viewers in near real time. You can give a link of your web-app which will be converted to a HLS feed by our server and can be played across devices for consumption.

Behind the scenes, this will be achieved by having a bot join your room and stream what it sees and hears. Once the feed is ready, the server will give a URL which can be played using any HLS Player.

> Note that the media server serving the content in this case is owned by 100ms. If you're looking for a way to stream on YouTube, Twitch, etc. then please have a look at our RTMP streaming docs [here](recording).

## Permissions

Can't let just anyone stream and record using HLS. First, you need to create a [role](/react-native/v2/foundation/templates-and-roles) with the "HLS livestream" and "Beam Recording" permissions.

You can check if you (local peer) have permission to HLS stream as follows -

```ts
const localPeer = await hmsInstance.getLocalPeer();

// Permissions are available on `HMSRole` object of Local Peer
const localPeerPermissions: HMSPermissions = localPeer.role?.permissions;

// Check if Local Peer has HLS Live stream permission
const canHLSStream: boolean = localPeerPermissions?.hlsStreaming;
```

## Starting HLS Stream

HLS can be started in two ways depending on the level of customization you need -

1. Default View: The simplest view to just begin a stream with default UI and parameters.
2. Custom Views: To use your own UI for HLS streaming, you need to provide your own web-app URL for our bot to join and stream. Also, we can record the stream.

### Default View

Begins a stream with default parameters.

You can use `startHLSStreaming` method available on `HMSSDK` instance to start the HLS Stream with default parameters as follows -

```js
try {
    await hmsInstance.startHLSStreaming();
    console.log('HLS Stream Start Success');
} catch (error) {
    console.log('HLS Stream Start Error: ', error);
}
```

### Custom View

To use our own browser UI for HLS, you'll need to pass in a meeting URL. The 100ms bot will open this URL to join your room, so it must allow access without any user level interaction.

Let's understand this by following steps:

<div className="steps-container">

#### Create an HMSHLSConfig instance

`HMSHLSConfig` object will be used to start the HLS Stream with customizations.

```js
import {
    HMSHLSConfig,
    HMSHLSRecordingConfig,
    HMSHLSMeetingURLVariant
} from '@100mslive/react-native-hms';

const hlsURLVariant = new HMSHLSMeetingURLVariant({
    meetingUrl: 'https://...app.100ms.live/streaming/meeting...',
    metadata: ''
});

const hlsRecordingConfig = new HMSHLSRecordingConfig({
    singleFilePerLayer: false,
    videoOnDemand: false
});

const hlsConfig = new HMSHLSConfig({
    hlsRecordingConfig: hlsRecordingConfig,
    meetingURLVariants: [hlsURLVariant]
});
```

Let's look at how `HMSHLSConfig` object looks like -

```js
interface HMSHLSConfig {
    hlsRecordingConfig?: HMSHLSRecordingConfig;
    meetingURLVariants?: HMSHLSMeetingURLVariant[];
}
```

Now, Let's look at its properties one by one:

-   **hlsRecordingConfig**

    To record the HLS stream you may specify an `HMSHLSRecordingConfig` object within the `HMSHLSConfig` config object.

    Here's what the `HMSHLSRecordingConfig` looks like -

    ```js
    interface HMSHLSRecordingConfig {
        singleFilePerLayer: boolean;
        videoOnDemand: boolean;
    }
    ```

    1. `singleFilePerLayer` if the desired end result is a `mp4` file per HLS layer. `false` by default.
    2. `videoOnDemand` if the desired end result is a zip of `m3u8` and all the chunks, `false` by default.

-   **meetingURLVariants**

    This is a list of `HMSHLSMeetingURLVariant` objects. In the future, it'll be possible to start HLS Stream for multiple such URLs for the same room. So it's a list but currently only the first element of the list is used. To distinguish between multiple URLs an additional field `metadata` can be passed.

    Here's what the `HMSHLSMeetingURLVariant` looks like -

    ```js
    interface HMSHLSMeetingURLVariant {
        meetingUrl: string;
        metadata: string;
    }
    ```

    1. `meetingUrl` URL of the meeting you wish to record
    2. `metadata` meta-data (any extra info to identify the URL) you wish to pass with the URL.

#### Call startHLSStreaming method on HMSSDK instance

After creating config (`HMSHLSConfig`) object, You can use `startHLSStreaming` method available on `HMSSDK` instance with `HMSHLSConfig` object to start the HLS Stream as follows -

Make sure you have above mentioned permissions for starting HLS Stream.

```js
try {
    // Calling `startHLSStreaming` with config created in above step
    await hmsInstance.startHLSStreaming(hlsConfig);

    console.log('Start Hls Success');
} catch (error) {
    console.log('Start Hls Error: ', error);
}
```

</div>

## Stopping HLS Stream

You can use `stopHLSStreaming` method available on `HMSSDK` instance to stop HLS Streaming. This will stop all the streaming variants.

```js
try {
    await hmsInstance.stopHLSStreaming();
    console.log('Stop Hls Success');
} catch (error) {
    console.log('Stop Hls Error: ', error);
}
```

## Current Room Status

The current status for the room is always reflected in the `HMSRoom` object.

This can be used to show the live stream status on UI something similar to this:

![stream-state](/docs/v2/flutter-stream-state.jpg)

`hlsStreamingState` is the property inside the `HMSRoom` object which you can read to get the current HLS streaming status of the room.

This object contains a boolean `running` which lets you know if HLS is running in the room right now. Also, It contains a list of m3u8 URLs `variants`, which you can use along with [react-native-video](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-video) library to display HLS Stream on the screen.

**hlsStreamingState** is an instance of `HMSHLSStreamingState`, which looks like:

```js
interface HMSHLSStreamingState {
    running: boolean;
    variants: HMSHLSVariant[];
}
```

1. `running` - `true` indicates that HLS streaming is running

2. `variants` - This represents a live stream to one or more HLS URLs in the container of `HMSHLSVariant`. Which looks like:

```js
interface HMSHLSVariant {
    hlsStreamUrl?: string; // It contains m3u8 url which we will use to show the stream
    meetingUrl?: string; // URL of the room which is getting streamed
    metadata?: string; // Extra info about the room corresponding to meetingUrl which is passed in `HMSHLSMeetingURLVariant` while starting HLS
    startedAt?: Date; // time at which HLS Stream was started
}
```

## When to check for room status

The room status should be checked in following two places -

1. Inside `onJoinListener` function which is subscribed to `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_JOIN` event

2. Inside `onRoomListener` function which is subscribed to `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_ROOM_UPDATE` event. The `type` property will be `HMSRoomUpdate.HLS_STREAMING_STATE_UPDATED`.

## Key Tips

-   If you're using the dashboard web app from 100ms, please make sure to use a role which doesn't have publish permissions, for beam tile to not show up.

-   If using your own web app, do put in place retries for API calls like tokens etc. just in case any call fails. As human users, we're used to reloading the page in these scenarios which is difficult to achieve in the automated case.

-   Make sure to not disable the logs for the passed-in meeting URL. This will allow for us to have more visibility into the room, refreshing the page if join doesn't happen within a time interval.
