## Overview

Preview screen is a frequently used UX element which allows users to check if their input devices are working properly and set the initial state (mute/unmute) of their audio and video tracks before joining.

100ms SDKs provide an easy-to-use API to back this feature.
Additionally, the SDK will try to establish a connection to 100ms server to verify there are no network issues and that the auth credentials are valid so that if everything is in order the subsequent room join will be much faster.

## Start Preview

We'll call the `preview` method on `HMSSDK` object with a `HMSConfig` object.

<div className="steps-container">

### Create HMSSDK instance

First, create an instance of `HMSSDK` using the `build` function.

```js
import { HMSSDK } from '@100mslive/react-native-hms';

// create HMSSDK instance using the build function

/**
 * Important Note: Don't build new `HMSSDK` instance before destroying the previous one.
 * for more info checkout {@link https://www.100ms.live/docs/react-native/v2/how--to-guides/install-the-sdk/hmssdk#what-does-destroy-method-do}
 */
const hmsInstance = await HMSSDK.build();
```

### Generate Auth Token

You need Authentication Token to preview 100ms rooms. The recommended way to generate Auth Tokens is by using `getAuthTokenByRoomCode` method on `HMSSDK` instance.
You can learn more about this method in [Getter Methods](../listen-to-room-updates/get-methods#getAuthTokenByRoomCode) docs

> Checkout [Room Code](/concepts/v2/concepts/rooms/room-codes/room-codes) docs to learn more about Room Codes

```js
// Use Room Code for your room here
const roomCode = 'abc-defg-hij'; // Sample Room Code

const token = await hmsInstance.getAuthTokenByRoomCode(roomCode);
```

### Attach Event Listeners

It is advised to attach Event Listeners for `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_ERROR` and `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_PREVIEW` before calling the `preview` function to get updates if preview got executed successfully or if it failed.

```js
const onPreview = (data: { room: HMSRoom, previewTracks: HMSTrack[] }) => {
    // You can use `previewTracks` to render preview for the local peer
    console.log(data.previewTracks);
};

// add Event Listeners to subscribe to Preview Success or Failure updates
hmsInstance.addEventListener(HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_ERROR, onError);
hmsInstance.addEventListener(HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_PREVIEW, onPreview);
```

### Create HMSConfig object

Next, create an object of `HMSConfig` class using the available joining configurations.

```js
const config = new HMSConfig({
    authToken: token, // client-side token generated from `getAuthTokenByRoomCode` method
    username: 'John Appleseed'
});
```

### Invoke Preview function

Now, you are primed to preview the room and local tracks. All you have to do is call the `preview` method on `HMSSDK` object with a `HMSConfig` object.

```js
hmsInstance.preview(config);
```

After calling `preview` your app will be provided an update from the 100ms SDK.

✅ If successful, the `onPreview` function which is listening for `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_PREVIEW` event will be invoked with information about the Room and Local Audio & Video tracks.

❌ If failure, the `onError` function which is listening for `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_ERROR` event will be invoked with exact failure reason.

### Render Preview Tracks

In case of preview success, `onPreview` provides an array of local tracks in the parameter `previewTracks`.

You can use local audio track to change and show audio track mute status.

You can use `trackId` from local video track to [Render Video](https://www.100ms.live/docs/react-native/v2/features/render-video) of local peer, change and show video track mute status.

Refer to [Mute and Unmute Guide](https://www.100ms.live/docs/react-native/v2/features/mute) to know how to check and change mute status.

```js
// Get Local Audio Track from preview tracks
const regularAudioTrack = previewTracks.find((previewTrack) => {
    return (
        previewTrack.source === HMSTrackSource.REGULAR && previewTrack.type === HMSTrackType.AUDIO
    );
});

// Get Local Video Track from preview tracks
const regularVideoTrack = previewTracks.find((previewTrack) => {
    return (
        previewTrack.source === HMSTrackSource.REGULAR && previewTrack.type === HMSTrackType.VIDEO
    );
});

// If we have regular video track, then we can render it
if (regularVideoTrack) {
    return (
        <HmsView
            trackId={regularVideoTrack.trackId} // Render Video track by using its' trackId
            scaleType={HMSVideoViewMode.ASPECT_FILL}
            style={styles.hmsView}
            mirror={true}
        />
    );
}
```

### Receive Room Updates

To receive the `Room` updates like number of peers in the room or when new peer joins the room, You can also add listener for `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_ROOM_UPDATE` as follows -

> Note: To receive Room State in preview, that is, before joining the room, You can enable this feature in [Template](https://www.100ms.live/docs/react-native/v2/foundation/templates-and-roles) of the room. Refer [here](#get-peer-updates-and-room-state-in-preview) for more info

```js
const onRoomUpdate = (data: { room: HMSRoom, type: HMSRoomUpdate }) => {
    console.log(data.room.peerCount); // Number of peers inside Room
    console.log(data.room.peers); // list of peers inside Room
};

// This listener is called when there is a change in any property of the Room
hmsInstance.addEventListener(HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_ROOM_UPDATE, onRoomUpdate);
```

### Remove Preview event listener

When you are ready to [Join Room](https://www.100ms.live/docs/react-native/v2/features/join) or navigating away from preview, you don't need to keep listening to preview updates.

To stop receiving preview updates, we can remove the preview event listener as follows -

```js
hmsInstance.removeEventListener(HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_PREVIEW);
```

## Get Peer Updates and Room State in Preview

To enable Room State and Peer Updates in the preview, we need to enable room state from the dashboard.
This can be enabled by selecting a template and then navigating to advanced settings.

These options are available in advanced settings:
