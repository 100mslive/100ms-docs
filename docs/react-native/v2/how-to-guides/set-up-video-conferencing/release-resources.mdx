title: Release Resources
nav: 11

Releasing resources when they are not required anymore is an important part of the app.

If the resources are not released and acquired again time to time, it might hamper app performance.

When the hms instance is not required any more or when a new hms instance has to be created instead of using the previous one, "destroy" the previous instance.

You can call the `destroy` method available on `HMSSDK` instance to free resources. This method removes native and JS event listeners and destroys SDK instance on native side.

```js
try {
    await hmsInstance.destroy();
    console.log('Destroy Success');

    // Removing HMSSDK instance saved in redux or any other store
    clearHmsReference();
} catch (error) {
    console.log('Destroy Error: ', error);
}
```
