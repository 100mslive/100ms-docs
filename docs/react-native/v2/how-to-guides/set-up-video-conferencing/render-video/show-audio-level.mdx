## Getting Audio Levels for all speaking peers

We can find the currently speaking peers by subscribing to `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_SPEAKER` event as follows -

```js
import { HMSUpdateListenerActions, HMSSpeaker } from '@100mslive/react-native-hms';

// `onSpeaker` function will be invoked whenever active speaker changes in room
const onSpeaker = (data: HMSSpeaker[]) => {
    // data is the list of `HMSSpeaker` objects
    data.forEach((speaker: HMSSpeaker) => console.log('speaker audio level: ', speaker.level));
};

// hmsInstance obtained by build method
hmsInstance.addEventListener(HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_SPEAKER, onSpeaker);
```

Let's look at the `HMSSpeaker` class:

```js
interface HMSSpeaker {
    level: Number;
    peer: HMSPeer;
    track: HMSTrack;
}
```

Let's understand the properties of `HMSSpeaker` class:

1. `level` : Number -> The level of the audio. It may vary from 0-100. A higher value indicates a higher speaking volume.
2. `peer` : HMSPeer -> The peer who was speaking. This may be null if the peer has left before the update information has reached the other person.
3. `track` : HMSTrack -> The audio track corresponding to this speaker. It may be null when the speaker who was speaking loudly, leaves.

## Where can we use Active Speakers Updates

### Active Speaker Views

To maintain an active speaker view, such as the default view in the [Basic Sample App](https://github.com/100mslive/react-native-hms/tree/main/sample-apps/rn-quickstart-app), you need to keep track of active
speakers over time. We'll be using the Active Speakers list which we get in function subscribed to `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_SPEAKER` event as mentioned above and then building something that attempts to show all
the active speakers while minimizing re-ordering the list.

For advanced usage, do refer our fully featured [Example App here](https://github.com/100mslive/react-native-hms/tree/main/example).

### Dominant Speaker - the loudest speaker

The Active Speakers list which we get in function subscribed to `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_SPEAKER` event is already in descending order based on the audio level. So, the first element of the list will be loudest speaker.
