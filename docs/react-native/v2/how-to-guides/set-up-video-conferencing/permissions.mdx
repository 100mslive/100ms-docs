With `HMSRoles` it's important to only request the appropriate permissions for user comfort.
Some roles may require camera permissions, some may require the microphones and there are complex
 rules around whether bluetooth permission or bluetooth_connect permissions are required.

On Android, `HMSSDK` can simplify this by emitting an `ON_PERMISSIONS_REQUESTED` event during `join` and `preview` that
 contains the appropriate permissions to request from user. Perform following actions inside event handler:
1. Request the permissions
2. Tell the SDK when they've been granted.

## Implementation

### Enable ON_PERMISSIONS_REQUESTED event

```js{3}
const hmsInstance = await HMSSDK.build({
  ...
  haltPreviewJoinForPermissionsRequest: true,
  ...
});
```

### Listen to ON_PERMISSIONS_REQUESTED event

```js
import { PermissionsAndroid } from 'react-native';

...

useEffect(() => {
  const onPermissionsRequested = async (data: { permissions: Array<string>; }) => {
    // STEP 1: Request permissions
    await PermissionsAndroid.requestMultiple(data.permissions as Permission[]);

    // STEP 2: Tell the SDK when they've been granted.
    await hmsInstance.setPermissionsAccepted();
  };

  hmsInstance.addEventListener(
    HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_PERMISSIONS_REQUESTED,
    onPermissionsRequested
  );

  return () => {
    hmsInstance.removeEventListener(
      HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_PERMISSIONS_REQUESTED
    );
  };
}, [hmsInstance]);
```

### Tell the SDK that permissions have been granted

When the permissions are granted call:

```js
hmsInstance.setPermissionsAccepted()
```

> Without calling `setPermissionsAccepted` method, the SDK will remain stuck waiting in preview or join.
 It doesn't matter if the user denies some permissions, in that case the associated devices will not work.
  Whether the permissions have been accepted or denied, if you want the join/preview to continue, call this.

## What permissions may be requested

1. `android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO`: For roles with an audio broadcasting permission.
    - Without it the user's microphone will remain disabled throughout the call.

2. `android.permission.CAMERA`: For roles with camera publish permissions.
    - Without it the user's camera will remain disabled throughout the call.
