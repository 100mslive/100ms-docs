## Handle Raise and Lower Hand

Previously, We had to implement **hand raise** functionality with peer metadata.
But that is no more required, We have made raising/lowering hand as **first class API** on HMSSDK.

### How to Raise Hand

You can use `raiseLocalPeerHand` method available on `HMSSDK` instance to raise hand of local peer.

```js
// `hmsInstance` is an instance of `HMSSDK` class

await hmsInstance.raiseLocalPeerHand();
```

### How to Lower Hand

You can use `lowerLocalPeerHand` method available on `HMSSDK` instance to lower hand of local peer.

```js
// `hmsInstance` is an instance of `HMSSDK` class

await hmsInstance.lowerLocalPeerHand();
```

### How to Lower Hand of Remote Peer

You can use `lowerRemotePeerHand` method available on `HMSSDK` instance to lower hand of remote peer.
It accepts a peer (an instance of the HMSPeer class) of whom you want to lower the hand.


```js
// `hmsInstance` is an instance of `HMSSDK` class
// `peer` is a remote peer of whom we want to lower the hand

await hmsInstance.lowerRemotePeerHand(peer);
```

### How to know when a Peer raises or lowers hand

Whenever local/remote peer raises or lowers hand, `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_PEER_UPDATE` event 
is emitted with `HMSPeerUpdate.HAND_RAISED_CHANGED` update type. You can subscribe to this event and update the UI for updated peer.

```js
const onPeerListener = (data: { peer: HMSPeer; type: HMSPeerUpdate; }) => {
    const { peer, type } = data;

    if (type === HMSPeerUpdate.HAND_RAISED_CHANGED) {
        // {peer} has either raised or lowered its hand
        // Update UI for the {peer}

        // Parsing the updated Metadata
        const isHandRaised = peer.isHandRaised;
    }
};

hmsInstance.addEventListener(HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_PEER_UPDATE, onPeerListener);
```

### Get current hand raise status of peer

Now, `HMSPeer` instance has `isHandRaised` property on it. It will be `true` when 
peer has raised it's hand and `false` otherwise. You can use `peer.isHandRaised` property to 
get the current status.

```js
hmsPeer.isHandRaised
```

## How to get Total Peer count of the Room

You can use `peerCount` property of `HMSRoom` instance to get the latest peer count of the room. 
Whenever peer count is updated, `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_ROOM_UPDATE` event is emitted with `HMSRoomUpdate.ROOM_PEER_COUNT_UPDATED` update type.

```js
const roomUpdateHandler = (data: {
  room: HMSRoom;
  type: HMSRoomUpdate;
}) => {
  if (data.type === HMSRoomUpdate.ROOM_PEER_COUNT_UPDATED) {
    // Update UI of `room.peerCount`
  }
};

hmsInstance.addEventListener(
  HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_ROOM_UPDATE,
  roomUpdateHandler
);
```

## Large Room changes

### Get list of peers on join

When local peer join a room, it will not receive `ON_PEER_UPDATE` with
 `type === HMSPeerUpdate.PEER_JOINED` for each remote peer like it used to.
 Now, `ON_PEER_LIST_UPDATED` event is emitted with list of all the peers present
 in the room.

You can subscribe to `ON_PEER_LIST_UPDATED` event to get list of added or removed peers -

```js
const peerListUpdateHandler = (data: {
  addedPeers: HMSPeer[];
  removedPeers: HMSPeer[];
}) => {
  // here,
  // `data.addedPeers` is list of added peers in room
  // `data.removedPeers` is list of removed peers from room
};

hmsInstance.addEventListener(
  HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_PEER_LIST_UPDATED,
  peerListUpdateHandler
);
```

Note that on subsequent peer joins, both `ON_PEER_LIST_UPDATED` and `ON_PEER_UPDATE` with `type === HMSPeerUpdate.PEER_JOINED` events are emitted.
