The Poll feature in the HMS SDK allows you to create, manage, and participate in polls and quizzes. Polls are an effective way to gather opinions, feedback, and insights from a group of people in a quick and convenient manner. With the Poll feature, you can create custom polls, set their properties, add questions, and manage responses. You can also receive real-time updates on poll status, and view poll results in an organized and easy-to-use format.

This feature can also be used to create quizzes. Under the hood, quizzes are like polls where questions have right or wrong answers.

This document provides guidance on how to use the Poll APIs to create a poll, receive updates on a poll, and vote on a poll.

## Prerequisites

-   SDK 1.9.11 or higher
-   Poll Read permission should be enabled for roles that can view polls.
-   Poll Write and Poll Read permission should be enabled for roles that can create polls.

## Creating a Poll

### Quick Create

Here is how to quickly create a poll using poll builder.

Let's consider an example. We'll create a single-choice poll with the title `Survey` and the question `Do you like TypeScript?` The poll will offer two options: `Yes` and `No`.

```js
await hmsInstance.interactivityCenter.startPoll({
    pollId: 'myUniqueID',
    title: 'Survey',
    type: HMSPollType.poll,
    mode: HMSPollUserTrackingMode.customerUserID,
    questions: [
        {
            index: 1,
            text: 'Do you like TypeScript?',
            type: HMSPollQuestionType.singleChoice,
            skippable: false,
            options: [
                {
                    index: 1,
                    text: 'Yes'
                },
                {
                    index: 2,
                    text: 'No'
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
});
```

The above code will create a Poll with the specified title and a single choice question and share it with the Room.

## Receiving Updates on a Poll

Once you have started a Poll, you can receive real-time updates on the poll's status using the `addPollUpdateListener` method. This method allows you to listen for updates on the poll, such as when the poll is started, when the results are updated, and when the poll is stopped.

```js
///  enum HMSPollUpdateType {
///     started,
///     resultsUpdated,
///     stopped,
/// }

useEffect(() => {
    const subscription = hmsInstance.interactivityCenter.addPollUpdateListener(
        (poll: HMSPoll, pollUpdateType: HMSPollUpdateType) => {
            console.log('Poll Update: ', poll, pollUpdateType);
        }
    );
    return () => {
        subscription.remove();
    };
}, [...]);

```

You can use the `HMSPoll` object returned by the selector to access information about the poll, such as its current state, duration, and questions.

## Voting on a Poll

To participate in a poll, you can use the `add(pollQuestionResponseParams: PollQuestionResponseCreateParams)` method. This method allows you to vote on a poll by providing the poll ID, the index of the question you want to answer, and the response you want to submit.

```js
await hmsInstance.interactivityCenter.add({
    pollId,
    pollQuestionIndex: pollQuestion.index,
    responses: {
        options: [
            {
                text: 'Yes'
            }
        ]
    }
});
```

## Stopping a Poll

Use `hmsInstance.interactivityCenter.stop(pollId: string)` method when you want to stop the Poll and prevent further responses recorded.

```js
await hmsInstance.interactivityCenter.stop(pollId);
```
