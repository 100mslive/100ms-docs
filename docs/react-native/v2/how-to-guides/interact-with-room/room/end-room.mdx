Done with talking and it's time to end the video call room for everyone not just yourself? You may be looking to end the room.

## How to End Room

<div className="steps-container">

### Permissions

Can't let just anyone end the video call room. First you need to create a [Role](https://www.100ms.live/docs/react-native/v2/foundation/templates-and-roles) with the permissions to end a room.

The permission to end a room is called `permissions.endRoom` and you should check for that within the `HMSRole` of the peer to see if they have it.

Here's how to check whether the local peer has the permission to end the room:

```js
const localPeer = await hmsInstance.getLocalPeer();

const haveEndRoomPermission = localPeer.role?.permissions?.endRoom;
```

`await hmsInstance.getLocalPeer()` will not return null/undefined as long as you're in a preview or in a room.
Since you likely won't need to check for permissions if you're not in one it would be safe to omit null check.

### Ending the Room

Once you're sure the peer has the permissions to end the room, we can end the room by calling:

```js
const reason = 'Host ended the room'; // Reason to end the room
const lock = false; // whether to Lock room to prevent future joins

try {
    // instance acquired from build() method
    await hmsInstance.endRoom(reason, lock);

    console.log('End Room Success');

    // Navigate away from the Meeting screen, when end room is successful
    navigation.goBack();
} catch (error) {
    console.log('End Room Error: ', error);
}
```

`endRoom` takes the following parameters -

1. _lock_: A boolean for whether you want to prevent anyone from rejoining the room. If false, they will be allowed to enter the room again if the client called `join`. If this is true, they will NOT able to join this room again.
2. _reason_: reason string is the text that is passed describing why the room is being ended.

> ðŸ’¡ After calling endRoom, the video calling UI should be disposed of as well since only other peers will get the `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_REMOVED_FROM_ROOM` event. The caller can terminate the meeting room UI locally when the promise returned from `endRoom` is resolved.

## Handle App UI When Someone else Ends Room

This section explains how to handle the app UI when someone else ends the room.

Once the peer with adequate permissions calls `endRoom`, all other peers in the room will receive a `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_REMOVED_FROM_ROOM` event.

You can update your apps' UI and [Free Resources](https://www.100ms.live/docs/react-native/v2/features/release-resources) on receive of `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_REMOVED_FROM_ROOM` event.

```js
const onRemovedFromRoom = (data: {
    requestedBy: HMSPeer | null,
    reason: string,
    roomEnded: boolean
}) => {
    // Free App resources and do cleanup
    destroy();

    // Redirect to home screen or Navigate away from Meeting screen
    navigation.navigate('Home');
};

hmsInstance.addEventListener(HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_REMOVED_FROM_ROOM, onRemovedFromRoom);
```

> ðŸ’¡ This is the same callback that will be triggered if a peer is [removed from a room](https://www.100ms.live/docs/react-native/v2/features/remove-peer) as well. Except that `roomEnded` will be true when the entire room is ended.

Description of keys of data received from `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_REMOVED_FROM_ROOM` event:

-   _reason_: The string message detailing why the room was ended.
-   _requestedBy_: The details of the peer who called `endRoom`.
-   _roomEnded_: `true` if the entire room was ended. `false` if only the receiving peer(local peer) was removed.
