title: Music Mode (Beta) (iOS Only)
nav: 7.2

Use music mode to enable high quality audio streaming. This is useful when you have a use-case
of streaming music that's getting captured through the mic.


## Minimum Requirements

- SDK version 1.6.0 or higher
- iOS Platform


## What is Music Mode?

By default, the audio is pre-processed to cater to human voice by applying voice processing
methods like noise cancellation, automatic gain control etc. Also, a 32 Kbps max-bandwidth is
assinged for audio to keep the bandwidth low. If you have music playing in the background, it
gets suppressed and does not come out in it's best quality. The music mode is a setting that
removes voice-processing so that all type of frequencies get captured by the mic. It also makes
the max-bandwidth limit for audio to 320 Kbps so that music doesn't get compressed too much.


## How to turn on Music Mode?

1. You can create an instance of the `HMSAudioTrackSettings` class with the `audioMode` property set
to `HMSIOSAudioMode.MUSIC`. When the `audioMode` property is set to `HMSIOSAudioMode.MUSIC`, the
SDK will use 320 Kbps bandwidth for publishing audio instead of default 32 Kbps max-bandwidth.

Then, you can use this `HMSAudioTrackSettings` instance when building an instance of the `HMSDK`
class using the static `build` method.

```js{3}
// Creating Audio Setting with 'hardware echo cancellation' set to false
const audioSettings = new HMSAudioTrackSettings({
  audioMode: HMSIOSAudioMode.MUSIC
});

// Creating Track settings with Audio Settings for HMSSDK
const trackSettings = HMSTrackSettings({
  audio: audioSettings
});

// Pass the Track Settings object to the `build` method
// Now, the SDK will not use hardware echo cancellation
c̶o̶n̶s̶t̶ ̶h̶m̶s̶I̶n̶s̶t̶a̶n̶c̶e̶ ̶=̶ ̶a̶w̶a̶i̶t̶ ̶H̶M̶S̶S̶D̶K̶.̶b̶u̶i̶l̶d̶(̶)̶;̶
const hmsInstance = await HMSSDK.build({ trackSettings });
```

If you don't want to use Music Mode, don't create `HMSAudioTrackSettings` class with `audioMode`
property, it's an optional property.

2. In the newer iPhones (iPhone XS onwards) make sure that 'Wide Spectrum' mic mode is selected
in the control center. If you select 'Standard' or 'Voice Isolation' mode then your iPhone might
apply voice processing on top to affect the music quality.
