title: Camera Controls (Beta)
nav: 7.3

You can use `HMSCameraControls` class to access the camera controls APIs.

## Minimum Requirements

- SDK version 1.5.0 or higher

## Capture at the highest resolution offered by the camera

By using static `captureImageAtMaxSupportedResolution` method on `HMSCameraControls` class 
allows you to take the highest quality picture from the local video stream irrespective of 
network quality and video quality set in `HMSRole` of local peer.

`captureImageAtMaxSupportedResolution` accepts an optional parameter named `flash`, It's 
default value is `false`, if `true` is passed then device flashlight will be used while 
capturing the picture.

It returns a `Promise` which is resolved with the "path" of the captured picture saved on 
your device.

> ðŸ”‘ Note: `captureImageAtMaxSupportedResolution` method only works if camera is turned ON

> ðŸ”‘ Note: The captured picture is in `jpg` format on Android and in `png` format on iOS

```js
import { PermissionsAndroid, Platform } from 'react-native';
import { HMSCameraControl } from '@100mslive/react-native-hms';

...

// state to save captured image file path on device
const [capturedImageFilePath, setCapturedImageFilePath] = React.useState('');

...

try {
  // Step 1: Request External Storage Permission (WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE)

  // Note: You can also use (react-native-permissions)[https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-permissions] lib to handle permissions
  const granted = Platform.OS === 'ios'
    ? true
    : await PermissionsAndroid.request(
        PermissionsAndroid.PERMISSIONS.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE,
        {
          title: 'Storage Permission Required',
          message: 'Application needs access to your storage to save image file',
          buttonPositive: 'true',
        },
      );

  // Step 2: Capture Image

  const withFlash = true; // Use flashlight on device while capturing image

  // After the external storage permission has been granted, You can call method to capture image
  const imagePath: string = await HMSCameraControl.captureImageAtMaxSupportedResolution(withFlash);

  // Now you can use the image path to show the image, present a sharesheet or any other usecase

  // You may need to prefix `file://` on this path to show captured image in Image component provided by react native
  setCapturedImageFilePath(`file://${imagePath}`);

} catch (error) {
  // Handle the Error occured while trying to capture image accordingly
}

...

// Showing captured image to app users
<Image
  source={{ uri: capturedImageFilePath }} // `capturedImageFilePath` has "file://" prefixed
  style={{ width: '80%', height: '80%' }}
  resizeMode="contain"
/>
```

> ðŸ”‘ Note: You have to request the storage permission before calling this method because it will save the image on the device

> ðŸ”‘ Note: If flashlight is not supported on the device and `true` value is passed to the 
`captureImageAtMaxSupportedResolution` method for `flash` parameter, then this method will
throw and error
