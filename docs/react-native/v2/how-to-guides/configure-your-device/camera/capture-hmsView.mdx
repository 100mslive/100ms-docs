title: Frame Capture (HmsView)
nav: 10.1
---

The 100ms React Native SDK provides `HmsView` component that renders the video on screen. Check out [Render Video docs](/react-native/v2/how--to-guides/set-up-video-conferencing/render-video/overview) to know more about `HmsView` component.

You render videos of yourself (Local Peer) and remote peers on screen using this component. Sometimes, you may want to take a screenshot (or capture frame) only from video of a single remote peer instead of whole screen.

You can use `capture` method available on the ref([React Refs docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html)) of `HmsView` component to capture frame of video currently rendered by this component. `capture` method call resolves with `base64 string` which is the captured frame of the video stream.

> You also need ["External Storage Permission (WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE)"](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE) to capture frame of video stream.

This is how you can use `capture` method to capture frame of peers' video stream -

```js
import React from 'react';
import { TouchableOpacity, Text, View } from 'react-native';

// This Component handles rendering of HmsView
export const PeerTile = () => {
    // this `ref` will be reference to HmsView componentË€
    const hmsViewRef = React.useRef(null);

    // This function handles capturing frame of the video stream
    const captureVideoFrame = async () => {
        try {
            // First -> request for `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission before calling `capture` method on ref

            const base64Data = await hmsViewRef.current?.capture();
            // {base64Data} is the captured frame of the video stream
        } catch (error) {
            console.log(error);
        }
    };

    // `hmsInstance` acquired from `build` method
    // HmsView is available on `HMSSDK` instance.
    const HmsView = hmsInstance.HmsView;

    return (
        <View>
            {/* HmsView rendering video of a Peer */}
            <HmsView
                ref={hmsViewRef} // this ref can be used to capture frame of video stream with current tracKId
                key={trackId}
                trackId={trackId}
                style={{ height: '100%', width: '100%' }}
            />

            {/* Button to press when you want to take screenshot of peers' video */}
            <TouchableOpacity onPress={captureVideoFrame}>
                <Text>Take Screenshot</Text>
            </TouchableOpacity>
        </View>
    );
};
```
