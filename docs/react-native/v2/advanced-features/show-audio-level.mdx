### Getting Audio Levels for all speaking peers

```js
import {
  HMSUpdateListenerActions,
  HMSSpeaker,
} from '@100mslive/react-native-hms';

// hmsInstance obtained by build method
hmsInstance?.addEventListener(HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_SPEAKER, onSpeaker);

const onSpeaker = (data: HMSSpeaker[]) => {
  data?.map((speaker: HMSSpeaker) => console.log('speaker audio level: ', speaker?.level));  
};
```


Here are the properties on the HMSSpeaker class:

1. level : Number -> The level of the audio. It may vary from 0-100. A higher value indicates a higher speaking volume.
2. hmsTrack : HMSTrack -> The audio track corresponding to this speaker. It may be null when the speaker who was speaking loudly, leaves.
3. peer : HMSPeer -> The peer who was speaking. This may be null if the peer has left before the update information has reached the other person.



### Active Speaker Views
To maintain an active speaker view, such as the default view in the open source advanced sample app, you need to keep track of who the active
speakers are over time. We'll be using the input from `ON_SPEAKER` listener update as mentioned above and then building something that attempts to show all
the active speakers while minimizing re-ordering the list.
