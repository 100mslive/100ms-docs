Video/Audio conferencing is by nature a data intensive operation. The 100ms SDK attempts to stabilize connections especially if subscribe degradation 
is turned on in the template but it's possible for really bad connections that users will still have problems.

It can be helpful to measure a user's connection speed before joining a room in order to set expectations or decide to have them join with video off etc. Letting the participants know of each other's connection
status is also a great value addition.

Once you have joined the room, you can get a network quality score for all the peers including yourself.
You can also get current user's connection quality score when in preview.
The score ranges from -1 to 5, 5 being the hightest(Good Network) and 0 being the lowest(No Network).
-1 indicates an undefined state that is either the score hasn't yet been determined or it couldn't be determined.

> ⚠️ The downlink speed is measured by having the user download a file (1mb as of this writing) after the websocket connection is established during a 
preview.

The download will be continued for at most a fixed number of seconds (eg: 10 seconds) and the speed during that interval is calculated. 
The entire file may not be downloaded if it exceeds the timeout.

DNS time is not counted in this, only throughput is measured.

## Requesting/Reading Network Quality Updates

Network Quality information for every peer is available on `networkQuality` property of `HMSPeer` object. `networkQuality` property value is an instance of `HMSNetworkQuality` class -

```js
interface HMSNetworkQuality {
  downlinkQuality: number;
}
```

On `networkQuality` property value, we have `downlinkQuality` property which represents the peers' network quality. This is a number ranging from -1 to 5. To know about the meaning of each value refer to [Interpreting the Values](#interpreting-the-values) section.

Whenever network quality of a peer changes, `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_PEER_UPDATE` event is emitted with `HMSPeerUpdate.NETWORK_QUALITY_UPDATED` update type. Then inside the function subscribed to this event, you can can check `networkQuality` property on the updated `HMSPeer` object and update the UI accordingly.

```js
const onPeerListener = (data: { peer: HMSPeer; type: HMSPeerUpdate; }) => {
  const { peer, type } = data;

  // Network quality changed for {peer}
  if (type === HMSPeerUpdate.NETWORK_QUALITY_UPDATED) {
    console.log(`Network Quality of ${peer.name}: ${peer.networkQuality?.downlinkQuality}`);
  }
};

hmsInstance.addEventListener(HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_PEER_UPDATE, onPeerListener);
```


## Requesting/Reading Network Quality Updates in Preview

When creating a `HMSConfig` object to request a preview, You have to set the `captureNetworkQualityInPreview` property to `true` to get the users' downlink network 
quality in preview room state.

When information is available, `HMSUpdateListenerActions.ON_PEER_UPDATE` event is emitted with `HMSPeerUpdate.NETWORK_QUALITY_UPDATED` update type. Rest is same as mentioned in [above](#requesting-reading-network-quality-updates) section.

```js
import { HMSConfig } from '@100mslive/react-native-hms';

const config = new HMSConfig({
  authToken: '...jgvc...',
  username: 'John Applesead',
  captureNetworkQualityInPreview: true,
});

// hms instance acquired by build method
hmsInstance.preview(config);
```

Refer to [Preview Guide](../features/preview) to learn more about room preview


## Interpreting the Values

`Peer.networkQuality?.downlinkQuality` will be a value in range -1 to 5.

* -1 -> Undefined - yet to be determined or not enough data to determine
* 0 -> Disconnected or error in measuring score(in preview)
* 1 -> Very Bad Connection
* 2 -> Bad Connection
* 3 -> Moderate Connection
* 4 -> Good Connection
* 5 -> Excellent Connection

> 0 score in preview could also mean a failure in measuring the network due to firewall
block if the internet otherwise looks good.

## Showing in the UI

You can show this as a network icon on every peer tile or show only a list of peers not having good connection.
Feel free to checkout how the code from our dashboard app's implementation [here](https://github.com/100mslive/react-native-hms/tree/main/example)
where we show a network bar on each peer's tile as well in the participant list with a tooltip describing the connection state.
