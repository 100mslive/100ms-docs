**CLASS**

```swift
@objcMembers public class HMSSDK: NSObject
```

The public interface of 100ms SDK. Create an instance of HMSSDK to start using the SDK.
**Key Concepts**
**Room** - A room represents a real-time audio, video session, the basic building block of the 100mslive Video SDK
**Track** - A track represents either the audio or video that makes up a stream
**Peer** - A peer represents all participants connected to a room. Peers can be "local" or "remote"
**Broadcast** - A local peer can send any message/data to all remote peers in the room
HMSSDK has other methods which the client app can use to get more info about the Room, Peer and Tracks

## Properties

### localPeer

```swift
public var localPeer: HMSLocalPeer?
```

Returns the local peer, which contains the local tracks

### remotePeers

```swift
public var remotePeers: [HMSRemotePeer]?
```

Returns all remote peers in the room

### roles

```swift
public var roles: [HMSRole]
```

Returns all roles in the room

### room

```swift
public var room: HMSRoom?
```

Returns the room which was joined

### trackSettings

```swift
public var trackSettings: HMSTrackSettings = HMSTrackSettings()
```

to set a track settings different from default

### analyticsLevel

```swift
public var analyticsLevel: HMSAnalyticsEventLevel = .error
```

set the analytical level

### logLevel

```swift
public var logLevel: HMSLogLevel = .error
```

set the logging level

### logger

```swift
public weak var logger: HMSLogger?
```

## Methods

### join(config:delegate:)

```swift
public func join(config: HMSConfig, delegate: HMSUpdateListener)
```

To join a room created, clients need to create a HMSConfig instance and use that instance to call `join` method of HMSSDK
Use the HMSConfig and HMSUpdateListener instances to call `join` method on the instance of HMSSDK.
Once Join succeeds, all the callbacks keep coming on every change in the room and the app can react accordingly

- Parameters:
  - config: the config object instance which contains joining information
  - delegate: the update listener object which will receive all callbacks

#### Parameters

| Name     | Description                                                   |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| config   | the config object instance which contains joining information |
| delegate | the update listener object which will receive all callbacks   |

### leave()

```swift
public func leave()
```

Call the `leave` method on the HMSSDK instance to leave a room

### preview(config:delegate:)

```swift
public func preview(config: HMSConfig, delegate: HMSPreviewListener)
```

### send(message:)

```swift
public func send(message: HMSMessage)
```

### add(delegate:)

```swift
public func add(delegate: HMSUpdateListener)
```

### remove(delegate:)

```swift
public func remove(delegate: HMSUpdateListener)
```

### changeRole(for:to:force:)

```swift
public func changeRole(for peer:HMSRemotePeer, to role: HMSRole, force: Bool = false)
```

### accept(changeRole:)

```swift
public func accept(changeRole request: HMSRoleChangeRequest)
```

### build(block:)

```swift
public static func build(block: ((HMSSDK) -> Void)? = nil) -> HMSSDK
```

this will instantiate an HMSSDK object

- Parameter block: pass a block with different settings as required
- Returns: an instance of HMSSDK object

#### Parameters

| Name                     | Description                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| block                    | pass a block with different settings as required |
| ent settings as required |
