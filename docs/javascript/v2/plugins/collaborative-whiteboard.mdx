## Overview

This guide will walk you through instructions to build a Collaborative whiteboard by integrating Pusher with our [sample app](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-web).

You need three components to complete the Collaborative whiteboard setup:

1. [Pusher Channels app](#usher-channels-app)
2. [Whiteboard server](#whiteboard-server) — this guide follows Vercel deployment.
3. [Whiteboard client](#whiteboard-client) — this guide uses the [100ms-web sample app](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-web).

## Pusher Channels App

-   Sign up for a [Pusher account](https://pusher.com/).
-   Click on `Create app` to create a new `Channels app`.
-   Provide a friendly `name for your app` and `select a cluster` based on your preference.
-   Go to the `App Keys` section on the sidebar, and copy your app_id, key, secret, and cluster.
-   Go to the `App Settings` section on the sidebar and turn on `enable client events`.

## Whiteboard Server

-   Fork the [Whiteboard Pusher server](https://github.com/100mslive/whiteboard-server) and deploy it using your preferred hosting provider.
-   Add the Pusher keys noted earlier to environment variables.

```bash
APP_ID="app_id"
APP_KEY="key"
APP_SECRET="secret"
APP_CLUSTER="cluster"
```

-   The API path is `api/pusher/auth`; say your deployment URL is `whiteboard-server.vercel.app`, then the Pusher Auth Endpoint will be `https://whiteboard-server.vercel.app/api/pusher/auth`.

## Whiteboard Client

-   From the [100ms-web sample app](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-web) repository, copy the whole folder at `/src/plugins/whiteboard` into your live video conferencing or live streaming apps using 100ms' SDKs.
-   Add the Pusher `app key` and Pusher auth endpoint to `REACT_APP_PUSHER_APP_KEY` and `REACT_APP_PUSHER_AUTHENDPOINT` environment variables.
-   The `useWhiteboardMetadata` hook returns a state such as the whiteboard owner(`whiteboardOwner`) and action to toggle the whiteboard(`toggleWhiteboard`). Refer to usage in `ToggleWhiteboard.jsx` - an icon button to toggle the whiteboard based on the active state.
-   When the whiteboard is active(`whiteboardOwner` from `useWhiteboardMetadata` is not null), render the `Whiteboard` component on your UI to let your users draw on the whiteboard. Refer `mainView.jsx` and `WhiteboardView.jsx`.
