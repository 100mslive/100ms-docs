title: Error Handling
nav: 1.40

When you make an API call to access an HMS SDK, the SDK may return error codes.
ErrorCodes are usually returned when a problem that cannot be recovered without app intervention has occurred.

These are returned as `type='error'` through the [notifications interface](/javascript/v2/features/notifications). The type of `notification.data` is `HMSException`. Find the [HMSException interface here](/api-reference/javascript/v2/interfaces/HMSException).

## Handling Autoplay Error

![Device Change Settings](/guides/autoplay-error.png)

Most browsers have a restriction on audio autoplay where audio is allowed only if the user has interacted with the page. You can read
more about the restrictions here for [chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/autoplay/) and [safari](https://webkit.org/blog/7734/auto-play-policy-changes-for-macos/).

Sample UI for handling autoplay code
[code](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-web/blob/4ea9353b11e6a908ade8c77a9e8a84ddb189c94e/src/components/Notifications/AutoplayBlockedModal.jsx#L6C1-L6C1/)

If an autoplay error is received(code=3008), UI can show a popup or a notification with button. Once a user click has happened confirming an interaction point,
unblockAudio can be called.

```js
await hmsActions.unblockAudio();
```

## Error Codes

Following are the different error codes that are returned by the SDK. Before returning any error code, SDK retries the errors wherever possible.

| **Error Code** | **Cause of the error**                                                                                    | **Action to be taken**                                                                                      |
