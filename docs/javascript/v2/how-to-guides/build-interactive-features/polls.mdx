The Poll feature in the HMS SDK allows you to create, manage, and participate in polls and quizzes. Polls are an effective way to gather opinions, feedback, and insights from a group of people in a quick and convenient manner. With the Poll feature, you can create custom polls, set their properties, add questions, and manage responses. You can also receive real-time updates on poll status, and view poll results in an organized and easy-to-use format.

This feature can also be used to create quizzes. Under the hood, quizzes are like polls where questions have right or wrong answers.

This document provides guidance on how to use the Poll APIs to create a poll, receive updates on a poll, and vote on a poll.

## Prerequisites

- `@100mslive/hms-video-store@0.10.10` / `@100mslive/react-sdk@0.8.10` or higher
- Poll Read permission should be enabled for roles that can view polls
- Poll Write and Poll Read permission should be enabled for roles that can create polls

## Creating a Poll

### Quick Start

Here is how to quickly start a poll

```jsx
await actions.interactivityCenter
  .startPoll({
    id,
    title,
    anonymous,
    rolesThatCanViewResponses: ["host", "guest"],
    type: "poll", // or "quiz"
    questions: [
      {
        type: "single-choice",
        text: "How is the weather today?",
        options: [
          {
            text: "hot",
            isCorrectAnswer: true, // in case of quiz
          },
          { text: "warm" },
          { text: "cold" },
        ],
      },
    ],
  })
```

This code will create a poll with the specified title and a single choice question and share it with the room. 

### Staged Poll Creation

Sometimes you might want to create a poll but not start it immediately or you might want meeting co-host to review and edit the poll before starting. For this you can use separate APIs to create a poll, set its questions and start it. 

```jsx
// Create a poll
await actions.interactivityCenter
  .createPoll({
    id,
    title,
    anonymous,
    rolesThatCanViewResponses: ["host", "guest"],
    type: "poll", // or "quiz"
  })


// Add questions to the created poll
await actions.interactivityCenter.addQuestionsToPoll(id, [
  {
    type: "single-choice",
    text: "How is the weather today?",
    options: [
      {
        text: "hot",
        isCorrectAnswer: true, // in case of quiz
      },
      { text: "warm" },
      { text: "cold" },
    ],
  },
]);

// After this you can use selectPolls selector on remote peers end so that other users can view/edit them prior to start.

// Start the poll
await actions.interactivityCenter.startPoll(id);
```

## Receiving Updates on a Poll

Once you have start a poll, you can receive real-time updates on the poll's status and results using POLL_CREATED, POLL_STARTED, POLL_STOPPED, POLL_VOTES_UPDATED notifications. Also the poll is updated in the HMSStore and can be retrieved as

```jsx
// vanilla JS usage
const poll = hmsStore.getState(selectPollByID(id));

// react-sdk usage
const poll = useHMSStore(selectPollByID(id));
```

You can use the `HMSPoll` object returned by the selector to access information about the poll, such as its current state, duration, and questions. 

## Voting on a Poll

To participate in a poll, you can use the `addResponsesToPoll(id: string)` method in `HMSInteractivityCenter`. You can provide selected options or answers to short or long answer questions, depending on the question type.

```jsx
await actions.interactivityCenter.addResponsesToPoll(pollID, [
  {
    questionIndex: 5, // index of the question
    option: 1, // index of the option if it's a single-choice question
    options: [1, 2], // array of indices if it's a multiple-choice question
  },
]);
```

Once you have submitted your responses, other peers in the room will get `POLL_VOTES_UPDATED` notification. You can check updated vote counts for each option of poll questions.

## Stopping a Poll

Use `hmsActions.interactivityCenter.stopPoll(id)` when you wanâ€™t to prevent further responses recorded.

## Fetching the Quiz Leaderboard

Once the quiz has ended, the leaderboard can be fetched which has the quiz summary and peer level statistics sorted by score using the asynchronous `fetchLeaderboard` function added to the interactivityCenter.

```js

const fetchLeaderboardData = async () => {
        const leaderboardData = await hmsActions.interactivityCenter.fetchLeaderboard(poll, 0, 50);
        setPollLeaderboard(leaderboardData);
    };

```

The props accepted are:
- `poll` :HMSPoll - The poll object
- `offset` :number - The position offset after which the peer level entries should be fetched
- `count` :number - The number of peer entries that should be fetched at a time

The response contains an array of entries of type `HMSPollLeaderboardEntry` and a boolean `hasNext` to know there are more entries
```
{
  entries: [...],
  hasNext: false
}
```

## Viewing Poll Results Summary

After poll has ended you can use `poll.result` to get statistics like how many peers responded and how many total peers were in the room at the time of poll.
