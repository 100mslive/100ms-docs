You can now enable PDF annotations and sharing, allowing users to share and annotate PDFs in real-time, providing a rich immersive experience without tab switching. The PDF shared will be visible on all platforms (as a screen share).

## Use our Sample App

If you are currently using a fork of our sample app, make sure to pull the most recent updates from the main branch. PDF sharing functionality should work seamlessly without any additional modifications.

## Build your own UI
If you aren't using our Sample App and are building a completely custom UI, there are a few steps required to enable PDF annotations and sharing.

    "Add UI to prompt the user to select a local PDF file or provide a URL.",
    "Add an iframe to embed the PDF viewer within your UI and start Sharing",
    "Check if everything is good to go and start sharing the PDF"

### Add UI to Enable PDF Sharing

![Enable PDF Sharing](/docs/v2/pdf-sharing/pdf-sharing-start-sharing.png)

Add UI elements to enable PDF sharing for your users. Use role permissions to decide if you want to allow PDF sharing for users in a room. Note: Disable PDF sharing UI for users when there's an ongoing sharing session. 

You can refer to the code snippet in our repository to learn more about how we built this. [View Snippet](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-web/blob/main/src/components/pdfAnnotator/shareScreenOptions.jsx)

### Add UI to Enable PDF Selection

![PDF Selection](/docs/v2/pdf-sharing/pdf-sharing-user-input.png)

Next, you need to prompt the user to provide input, either by selecting a local PDF file or providing a PDF URL. We also recommend implementing validation to handle scenarios such as:
  1. Invalid local PDF file.
  2. Invalid or non-PDF URL.

Check out the code snippet in our repository to see how we built this. [View Snippet](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-web/blob/main/src/components/pdfAnnotator/pdfFileOptions.jsx)

### Render the PDF in your UI

![Embed PDF Viewer](/docs/v2/pdf-sharing/pdf-sharing-embed.png)

Finally, add an iframe to the DOM and make sure it refrences the `iframeRef` from ```usePDFShare```

```jsx
const { iframeRef } = usePDFShare();

<iframe
  ref={iframeRef}
  style={{
    width: "100%",
    height: "100%",
    border: 0,
    borderRadius: "0.75rem",
  }}
  allow="autoplay; clipboard-write;"
  referrerPolicy="no-referrer"
/>
```

### Start Sharing

```jsx
const pdfConfig = useHMSStore(selectAppData(APP_DATA.pdfConfig));
const resetConfig = useResetPDFConfig();

const { iframeRef, startPDFShare, stopPDFShare, isPDFSharingInProgress } = usePDFShare(resetConfig);

useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
      if (pdfConfig && !isPDFSharingInProgress) {
        try {
          await startPDFShare(pdfConfig);
        } catch (error) {
          console.log("Couldn't start PDF Sharing", error);
        }
      }
    })();
  }, [isPDFSharingInProgress, pdfConfig, resetConfig, startPDFShare]);
  ```
