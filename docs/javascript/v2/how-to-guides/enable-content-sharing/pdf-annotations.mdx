You can now enable PDF annotations and sharing, allowing users to share and annotate PDFs in real-time, providing a rich immersive experience without tab switching. The PDF shared will be visible on all platforms (as a screen share).

## Building custom UI
If you aren't using our Sample App and are building a completely custom UI, there are a few steps required to enable PDF annotations and sharing.

    "Add UI to prompt the user to select a local PDF file or provide a URL.",
    "Add an iframe to embed the PDF viewer within your UI to render the selected PDF and start sharing.",

### Add UI to Enable PDF Sharing

![Enable PDF Sharing](/docs/v2/pdf-sharing/pdf-sharing-start-sharing.png)

Add UI elements to enable PDF sharing for your users. Use role permissions to decide if you want to allow PDF sharing for users in a room. Note: Disable PDF sharing UI for users when there's an ongoing sharing session. 

You can refer to the code snippet in our repository to learn more about how we built this. [View Snippet](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-web/blob/main/src/components/pdfAnnotator/shareScreenOptions.jsx)

### Add UI to Enable PDF Selection

![PDF Selection](/docs/v2/pdf-sharing/pdf-sharing-user-input.png)

Next, you need to prompt the user to provide input, either by selecting a local PDF file or providing a PDF URL. We also recommend implementing validation to handle scenarios such as:
  1. Invalid local PDF file.
  2. Invalid or non-PDF URL.

Check out the code snippet in our repository to see how we built this. [View Snippet](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-web/blob/main/src/components/pdfAnnotator/pdfFileOptions.jsx)

You need to save the state of pdf configuration file or url using [usePDFConfig](/api-reference/javascript/v2/react-hooks/home/content#usepdfconfig)

### Render and Share the PDF

![Embed PDF Viewer](/docs/v2/pdf-sharing/pdf-sharing-embed.png)

Finally, add an iframe element that points to the PDF viewer and start screen sharing. You can refer to the code snippet and comments below:

```jsx
import { useRegionCaptureScreenShare } from "@100mslive/react-sdk";

/**
 * PDFEmbedComponent is responsible for rendering the PDF iframe and managing the screen sharing functionality.
 */
export const PDFEmbedComponent = () => {
  // it will responsible to start sharing the screen.
  const { regionRef } = useRegionCaptureScreenShare();

  return (
    <iframe
      title="PDF Annotator"
      ref={regionRef}
      style={{
        width: "100%",
        height: "100%",
        border: 0,
        borderRadius: "0.75rem",
      }}
      allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture fullscreen"
      referrerPolicy="no-referrer"
    />
  );
};

export default PDFView;
```
