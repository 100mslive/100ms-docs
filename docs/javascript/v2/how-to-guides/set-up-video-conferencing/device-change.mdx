Device changes include changes in audio/video input and audio output devices. Plugging a headset, or disconnecting your airpods mid call are
some of the example of device changes. These are all taken care of by the SDK without requiring any code.

## Manual Device Change

![Device Change Settings](/guides/settings.png)

You may still want to allow users to see the currently selected devices and change them if required. We'll do this in three steps -

1. Fetching all attached devices list from `hmsStore`.
2. Fetching the currently selected devices from `hmsStore`.
3. Calling `hmsActions` to change the device if required.

> Note that changing audio output device is available only in chromium based browsers.

<Tabs id="devicechange" items={['JavaScript', 'React']} />

<Tab id='devicechange-0'>

```js
// {audioInput, audioOutput, videoInput}
const devices = hmsStore.getState(selectDevices);

// {audioInputDeviceId, audioOutputDeviceId, videoInputDeviceId}
const selected = hmsStore.getState(selectLocalMediaSettings);

// show user a settings component to manually choose device
// The following selected devices can be obtained when changed from your UI.

// Update AudioInput device by calling
hmsActions.setAudioSettings({ deviceId: selectedAudioDeviceID });
// Update VideoInput device by calling
hmsActions.setVideoSettings({ deviceId: selecedVideoDeviceID });
// Update AudioOutput device by calling
hmsActions.setAudioOutputDevice(selectedAudioOutputDeviceID);
```

</Tab>

<Tab id='devicechange-1'>

```jsx
import { useDevices, DeviceType } from '@100mslive/react-sdk';

const DeviceSettings = () => {
    const { allDevices, selectedDeviceIDs, updateDevice } = useDevices();
    // Call the updateDevice function like below to update the videoInput device. Similarly for audio input and output pass corresponding deviceId and DeviceType
    updateDevice({
        deviceId,
        deviceType: DeviceType.videoInput
    });

    // render devices and selection from allDevices and selectedDeviceIDs
    return <div />;
};
```

</Tab>

## Switch Camera

The following method will switch between the front and back camera, if both are present

```js
 await hmsActions.switchCamera();
```
This will automatically update the selected video device in [settings](/api-reference/javascript/v2/interfaces/HMSStore#settings).

## Remember manually selected devices

We support an additional boolean in join config which can be passed in to let sdk use the localstorage to remember
manual device selections for future room [join](./join).

<Tabs id="rememberdeviceselection" items={['JavaScript', 'React']} />

<Tab id='rememberdeviceselection-0'>

```js
await hmsActions.join({ ...joinConfig, rememberDeviceSelection: true });
```

</Tab>

<Tab id='rememberdeviceselection-1'>

```jsx
const JoinCall = () => {
    const hmsActions = useHMSActions();
    const join = useCallback(async () => {
        await hmsActions.join({ ...joinConfig, rememberDeviceSelection: true });
    }, [hmsActions]);

    return <button onClick={join}>Join</button>;
};
```

</Tab>

> Note that `hmsActions.attachVideo` should be called when there's a change in camera. Refer [Render Video](/javascript/v2/how--to-guides/set-up-video-conferencing/render-video/overview#when-to-attachdetach-videos) section to see how to handle it.
