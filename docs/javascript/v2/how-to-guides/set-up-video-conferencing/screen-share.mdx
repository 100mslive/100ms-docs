Screenshare involves sharing either the complete screen, a specific window or, a browser tab.
For a peer to share their screen, their role must have screenshare enabled in the dashboard.

To start a screenshare:

```js
try {
    await hmsActions.setScreenShareEnabled(true);
} catch (error) {
    // an error will be thrown if user didn't give access to share screen
}
```

## AudioOnly Screenshare

To start audio only screenshare, you can pass a config as second argument.

```js
try {
    await hmsActions.setScreenShareEnabled(true, {
        audioOnly: true
    });
} catch (error) {
    // an error will be thrown if user didn't give access to share screen
}
```

## VideoOnly Screenshare

To start video only screenshare, you can pass a config as second argument.

```js
try {
    await hmsActions.setScreenShareEnabled(true, {
        videoOnly: true
    });
} catch (error) {
    // an error will be thrown if user didn't give access to share screen
}
```

To stop the screenshare:

```js
hmsActions.setScreenShareEnabled(false);
```

## Useful Selectors

```js
// to know if someone is screensharing
const screenshareOn = hmsStore.getState(selectIsSomeoneScreenSharing);

// to get the HMSPeer object of the peer screensharing, will select  first if multiple screenshares
const presenter = hmsStore.getState(selectPeerScreenSharing);

// to get the HMSPeer object of all the peers screensharing
const presenters = hmsStore.getState(selectPeersScreenSharing);

// a boolean to know if the local peer is the one who is screensharing
const amIScreenSharing = hmsStore.getState(selectIsLocalScreenShared);

// to get the screenshare video track, this can be used to call attachVideo for rendering
const screenshareVideoTrack = hmsStore.getState(selectScreenShareByPeerID(presenter.id));

// Get the peer who is sharing audio only screenshare
const peer = hmsStore.getState(selectPeerSharingAudio);
// Get the audio track of audio Only screenshare
const audioTrack = hmsStore.getState(selectScreenShareAudioByPeerID(peer?.id));
```

## Screenshare with audio:

We also give support of adding screenshare with audio in chromium based browsers. This only applies if checkbox at bottom left
shown below is checked while sharing a browser tab.
