## Overview

PiP Mode lets the user watch the room video in a small window pinned to a corner of the screen while navigating between apps or browsing content on the main screen.

100ms PiP selects top 4 peers with video enabled and render them in the PiP window.

> NOTE: Local Peer is not shown in PiP by default

## Implementation

### React projects

For implementation copy this [folder](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-web/tree/main/src/components/PIP) to your react project.

Add `worker-timers` as a dependency.

```jsx
import { PIP } from '../path-to-above-folder';

function SomeComponent() {
    return <PIP />;
}
```

Our [sample app implementation](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-web/blob/main/src/components/PIP/index.jsx) prioritizes the pinned tiles in PiP mode, you can remove this if not required.

### Non-React projects

For non React projects, you can use `PictureInPicture` from PIPManager in the above folder and use it to start/stop PiP, check whether it is supported or not.

```js
import { PictureInPicture } from '../path-to-above-folder/PIPManager';
import { MediaSession } from '../path-to-above-folder/SetupMediaSession';

PictureInPicture.isSupported(); // to check if PiP is supported. This depends on browser implementation. For example, it is not supported in firefox
PictureInPicture.isOn(); // to check whether PiP is enabled.

// To start pip, pass hmsActions and a callback function which receives the current state of pip
PictureInPicture.start(hmsActions, setIsPipOn).catch((err) =>
    console.error('error in starting pip', err)
);
// Call this to show controls in PiP window.(Audio toggle, Video toggle and end call are the options supported here)
MediaSession.setup(hmsActions, store);

// To stop pip
PictureInPicture.stop().catch((err) => console.error('error in stopping pip', err));
```

## Customization(in React)

If you want to render custom peers in PiP from your end, you can pass those peers in the `PIPComponent` in the above folder.

For example, if you want to show peers of particular role only in PiP, the following can be done.

```jsx
import { useHMSStore, selectPeersByRole } from '@100mslive/react-sdk';

function PIP() {
    const peers = useHMSStore(selectPeersByRole('some-role'));

    return <PIPComponent peers={peers} />;
}
```

To include local peer in PiP, just pass `showLocalPeer` to PIPComponent.

```jsx
function PIP() {
    return <PIPComponent showLocalPeer />;
}
```

## Limitations:

-   PiP is not supported in Firefox
-   PiP is flaky in safari due to it's canvas rendering issues. check [known issues](/javascript/v2/how--to-guides/debugging/known-issues) for more information
