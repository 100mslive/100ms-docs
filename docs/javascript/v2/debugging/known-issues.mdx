We'll list any issues related to our sdk or browsers/devices here along with any possible workarounds.

1. Audio routing issues in iOS Safari. The audio is sometimes routed to the phone speaker when an earphone is connected. For the end user, this appears as if
   the volume is too low. This is an issue in Safari 15, please track the [webkit bug](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=230902) for more info. We recommend
   showing a prompt for using earphones to the user till this is fixed by Safari.

2. If there is no audio in the room for a while iOS Safari can take away autoplay permission requiring a user interaction
   to play future audio. Check our section on handling autoplay errors [here](../features/error-handling#handling-autoplay-error).

3. Controlling the volume of audio elements is not supported by iOS. So, [locally setting remote peer volume](../advanced-features/volume-control) won't work in iOS.
   However, `hmsActions.setVolume(0, trackId)` and `hmsActions.setVolume(100, trackId)` will mute and unmute audio respectively.
