title: Peer Metadata
nav: 5.03

Looking for persistent state that can be set on a peer and updated anytime, for everyone in the room? Peer metadata it is.
Metadata can be set initially in the `HMSConfig` object that's passed into the join method and update post join by
following the API below. You can imagine metadata as a persistent object attached to the peer which has more details about
them.

We'll explain the API using an example of implementing raise hand. For this, we'll use the below interface for metadata -

```ts
interface CustomMetadata {
    isHandRaised: boolean;
}
```

## Getting and Setting metadata

Note that `peer.metadata` is a string, it can be used to keep a stringified JSON. The string will be converted properly
to a json object however if you use the selector described below.
Metadata update post join can be achieved by calling `hmsActions.changeMetadata(metadata)`, the below example shows implementing a toggle raise
hand function for the local peer.

```js
async function toggleRaiseHand() {
    const localPeerId = hmsStore.getState(selectLocalPeerID);
    const metadata = hmsStore.getState(selectPeerMetadata(localPeerId));
    const newMetadata = { ...metadata, isHandRaised: !metadata.isHandRaised };
    await hmsActions.changeMetadata(newMetadata);
}
```

## Peer Metadata update Notification

Once the metadata is updated, all the peers will receive a notification
with type `METADATA_UPDATED` and [HMSPeer](../../../api-reference/javascript/v2/interfaces/HMSPeer)
object as notification data.

```js
hmsNotifications.onNotification((notification) => {
    switch (notification.type) {
        case HMSNotificationTypes.METADATA_UPDATED:
            const peer = notification.data;
            const { isHandRaised } = hmsStore.getState(selectPeerMetadata(peer.id));
            if (isHandRaised && !peer.isLocal) {
                toast(`${peer.name} raised their hand.`);
            }
            break;
    }
});
```

## Ideas

-   Implementing raise hand
-   Multiplayer games like chess, scribble, quizzes etc.
-   Store extra information such as profile picture for every peer which can be updated mid call
