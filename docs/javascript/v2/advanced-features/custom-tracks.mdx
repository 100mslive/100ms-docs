title: Add custom tracks

You can also add custom video or audio tracks to the sdk which will be published to others. Possible use cases -

-   a synthetic track which doesn't use camera
-   screenshare with custom-built annotations in an electron app.
-   audio track from a source other than microphone

To add a custom/auxiliary track, you need to get hold of a MediaStreamTrack object and add it using the `addTrack` method on `hmsActions`.

```js
/**
 * track: MediaStreamTrack - Track to be added
 * source?: 'regular' | 'screen' | 'plugin' - Source of track - default: 'regular'
 */
await hmsActions.addTrack(track, source);

// to remove the track
await hmsActions.removeTrack(trackId);
```

## Accessing custom/auxiliary tracks

```js
// if you have hold of the peer object, it'll have ids of all the auxiliary tracks
console.log(peer.auxiliaryTracks);

// to get the track from a track id you can do this
track = hmsStore.getState(selectTrackByID(trackId))

// all auxiliary tracks
hmsStore.getState(selectAuxiliaryTracksByPeerID(peer.id));

// audio auxiliary track
hmsStore.getState(selectAuxiliaryAudioByPeerID(peer.id));

// track with source as screenshare
hmsStore.getState(selectScreenShareByPeerID(peer.id));
hmsStore.getState(selectScreenShareAudioByPeerID(peer.id));
```
