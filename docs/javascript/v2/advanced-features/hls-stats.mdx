`@100ms-live/hls-stats` is a simple library that provides easy to use APIs for acquiring stats
for your HLS Stream.

## Initialization

Initializing is very simple. Just initialize Hls.js and pass that reference as well as a
video element to `HLSStats`and you are already done.

<Tabs id="stats-init" items={['Javascript', 'React']} />

<Tab id="stats-init-0">

```js
import Hls from 'hls.js';

/**
 * Initialize Hls.js and attach the video element.
 */
const hlsUrl = 'http://my-domain/stream.m3u8';
const hlsInstance = new Hls();
hlsInstance.loadSource(hlsUrl);
hlsInstance.attachMedia(videoEl);

/**
 * initialize HlsStats
 */
const hlsStats = new HlsStats(hlsInstance, videoEl);
```

</Tab>

<Tab id="stats-init-1">

```jsx
import Hls from "hls.js";

export function MyComponent() {
    const hls = new Hls(this.getHLSConfig());
    hls.loadSource(hlsUrl);
    hls.attachMedia(videoRef.current);
    hlsStats = new HlsStats(hls, videoEl);

    return (
       // something
    );
}
```

</Tab>

### Subscribing to Stats

`hlsStats` have a `subscribe` function which takes two parameter. a `callbackFn` and an `interval` in ms.
The `interval` tells how frequent you want hls-stats to report back to you. Default is 2000ms.

<Tabs id="stats-subscribe" items={['Javascript', 'React']} />

<Tab id="stats-subscribe-0">

```js
const unsubscribe = hlsStats.subscribe((state) => {
    // ...
});
```

</Tab>

<Tab id="stats-subscribe-1">

```jsx
import Hls from "hls.js";

export function MyComponent() {
   ...
   ...
    useEffect(() => {
    const unsubscribe = hlsStats.subscribe(state => {
        setHlsStatsState(state);
    });

    return () => {
      unsubscribe?.();
    };
  }, []);

   ...
   ...
}
```

</Tab>

the `subscribe()` also returns a reference to `unsubscribe()` function which could later be used to unsubscribe
from your subscription

## Exposed Stats

`hls-stats` currently exposes the following stats

| Name                             | Description                                             | Unit            | Usage                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| bandwidthEstimate                | The current bandwidth, as seen by the player            | bits per second | Use this to show the current network speed of the user                                        |
| bitrate                          | server indicated bitrate of current layer of HLS stream | bits per second | Use to know the bitrate required for current layer                                            |
| bufferedDuration                 | buffered duration from the current position             | ms              | This can be used to show how much data is buffered from the current location (forward buffer) |
| distanceFromLiveEdge             | The distance from the live edge                         | ms              | Used to know currently buffered duration ahead                                                |
| droppedFrames                    | The number of dropped frames till now                   |                 | Used to calculate the total number of dropped frames                                          |
| videoSize.width videoSize.height | The width and height of the video                       | px              | Used to know the resolution being played                                                      |
| watchDuration                    | Total duration watched                                  | ms              | used to know the overall watch duration (not the stream length)                               |
