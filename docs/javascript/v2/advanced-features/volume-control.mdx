Audio volume refers to the volume of an audio track as perceived on the receiving end. This is a number between 0 to 100.
To modify audio volume - 

```js
const volume = 70;

// set the volume across whole room for each track
hmsActions.setVolume(volume);

// set the volume for a specific track
hmsActions.setVolume(volume, "<track_id>");
```
