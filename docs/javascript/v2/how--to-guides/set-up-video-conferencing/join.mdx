title: Join Room
nav: 4.1
---

To join and interact with others in audio or video call, the user needs to join a `room`.

When user indicates that they want to _join_ the room, your app should have -

1. User Name - the name which should be displayed to other peers in the room.
2. [Auth Token](../guides/token) - the client side authentication token generated by the Token Service.

You can also optionally pass these fields -

1. settings: `{isAudioMuted, isVideoMuted}` - you can use this to set the initial audio/video state at time of join.
2. User metadata - this can be used to pass any additional metadata associated with the user.

We'll call the `join` method on `hmsActions` object with a config containing above fields to join the room.

> Note: join is async from this [version](../changelog/release-notes#2022-09-13)

```js:join.js
import { hmsActions } from './hms';

const config = {
    userName: 'Jon Snow',
    authToken: '<Auth token>', // client-side token generated from your token service
    settings: {
        isAudioMuted: true,
        isVideoMuted: false
    },
    metaData: JSON.stringify({city: 'Winterfell', knowledge: 'nothing'}),
    rememberDeviceSelection: true,  // remember manual device change
};

await hmsActions.join(config);

```

import { useHMSActions } from '@100mslive/react-sdk';

function Join() {
  const hmsActions = useHMSActions();

  const config = {
    userName: 'Jon Snow',
    authToken: '<Auth token>', // client-side token generated from your token service
    settings: {
        isAudioMuted: true,
        isVideoMuted: false,
    },
    metaData: JSON.stringify({city: 'Winterfell', knowledge: 'nothing'}),
    rememberDeviceSelection: true,  // remember manual device change
  };

  async function onJoinClick() {
    await hmsActions.join(config)
  }

  return <
        // form with input and join button
  />;
}
```

</Tab>

That's it. You have joined a room successfully ðŸ¥³. You should now be able to have an audio only call with this.

## Getting Current Room State

You might want to hide your join form from the UI or navigate to another page when the join has completed.
We provide [some selectors](/api-reference/javascript/v2/home/content#functions) which operate upon the room state to give the relevant information. One such
selector is [`selectIsConnectedToRoom`](/api-reference/javascript/v2/home/content#select-is-connected-to-room). Here's how to use it -

<Tabs id="connected" items={['JavaScript', 'React']} />{' '}

<Tab id='connected-0'>

```js
import { hmsStore } from './hms';
import { selectIsConnectedToRoom } from '@100mslive/hms-video-store';

// use getState to get the state at any time
console.log('isConnected - ', hmsStore.getState(selectIsConnectedToRoom));

function onRoomStateChange(connected) {
    console.log('isConnected - ', connected);
}

// you can also subscribe to the state and get your function called whenever the state changes
hmsStore.subscribe(onRoomStateChange, selectIsConnectedToRoom);
```

</Tab>

<Tab  id='connected-1'>

```jsx
import { useHMSStore, selectIsConnectedToRoom } from '@100mslive/react-sdk';

// if the connection state changes, the store hook will take care of rerendering the component
function ConnectionState() {
    const isConnected = useHMSStore(selectIsConnectedToRoom);

    return <div>{isConnected ? 'connected' : 'not connected, please join.'}</div>;
}
```

</Tab>

> For more granular
> room states, use [`selectRoomState`](/api-reference/javascript/v2/home/content#select-room-state).
