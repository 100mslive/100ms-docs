## Overview

[100ms-web](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-web) is a fully-featured sample application built using React. This application gives you a ready-made starting point for writing your video apps or customizing the cloned app based on your needs.

You can use this app to test:

-   **Basic functionalities**: Video calling, Recording, Interactive live streaming (HLS), External streaming (RTMP), Screenshare, and Picture-in-Picture (PiP).
-   **Interactive features**: Chat (broadcast, direct, & group), Raise hand.
-   **Plugins**: Virtual background, Collaborative whiteboard.

The app also includes other features and capabilities like custom audio/video tracks, control remote peers, network quality and performance stats, adaptive bitrate (Simulcast), and more.

The sample app is intended to accelerate development, provide a full reference of all the features and capabilities, and demonstrate implementation with easy-to-read code.

If you are a developer trying to build an app from scratch, please check our [quickstart guide](/javascript/v2/get-started/react-quickstart). Quickstart provides a simple and quick way to build a reference app and familiarize yourself with the different capabilities of the platform with minimal code.

## Local development

        'Clone the sample app repo and set it up on your local development environment.',

<StepsContainer id="local-development">

### Set up the app repo

-   Clone the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-web).

    ```bash section=cloneRepo sectionIndex=1
    git clone git@github.com:100mslive/100ms-web.git
    ```

-   Change your working directory to `100ms-web`.

    ```bash section=cloneRepo sectionIndex=2
    cd 100ms-web
    ```

-   Install the dependencies using `npm` or `yarn`.

    ```bash section=cloneRepo sectionIndex=3
    npm install or
    yarn install
    ```

### Configure auth token endpoint

-   Set environment variables to configure token generation endpoint. Use the following command to copy the values from "example.env" to a new file called ".env".

    ```bash section=envVariable sectionIndex=1
    cp example.env .env
    ```

-   Update the 100ms token endpoint as an environment variable to handle auth token generation. You can get your token endpoint from the [Developer section of 100ms' Dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/developer).

    ![token endpoint](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11087313/140727818-43cd8be4-b3bf-4b34-9921-a77f9a1b819d.png)

    **Example**:

    ```bash
    REACT_APP_TOKEN_GENERATION_ENDPOINT = 'https://prod-in2.100ms.live/hmsapi/example.app.100ms.live/'
    ```

### Start and test the app

#### Start the app

-   Start the app with the below command.

    ```bash section=runApp sectionIndex=1
    npm start or
    yarn start
    ```

-   The app should now be running at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). You should see a welcome message saying, "Almost There!".

#### Create and join a room

-   To test audio/video functionality, you need to connect to a 100ms room; please check following steps for the same:

    1. Navigate to your [100ms Dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/dashboard) or [create an account](https://dashboard.100ms.live/register) if you don't have one.
    2. To test this app quickly, use the "Video Conferencing Starter Kit" to create a room with a default template assigned to it.
    3. Go to [Rooms page](https://dashboard.100ms.live/rooms) in your Dashboard, copy the "Room Id" of the room and role created in the above step.
    4. Add the "Room Id" and role to the localhost URL to test the app. For example, `http://localhost:3000/633fcdd84208780bf665346a/host`

    <video loop="true" autoplay="autoplay" controls="controls" id="vid" muted>

    </video>

## Next steps

#### [Customize the app](/javascript/v2/get-started/react-sample-app/customize-the-app)

Customize your UI like updating logo, tile aspect ratio, theme, etc. as per your brand.

#### [Build and deploy](/javascript/v2/get-started/react-sample-app/build-and-deploy)

Building and deploying the 100ms sample app is simple and the same as any React project. You can deploy this to Vercel, Netlify, AWS, Web server, Docker, etc., as you prefer.

#### [iframe integration](/javascript/v2/get-started/react-sample-app/embed-with-iframe)

You can use the [deployed](/javascript/v2/get-started/react-sample-app/build-and-deploy) URL in an iframe to embed the whole sample app inside your UI.

#### [Code structure](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-web/wiki/code-structure)

Check the overall project structure of the sample app to understand how the code is organized and understand various components of the app.

#### [Simple quickstart](/javascript/v2/get-started/react-quickstart)

Please check our quickstart guide if you're trying to get started with 100ms with a basic app.
