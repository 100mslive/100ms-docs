## Overview

This [sample app](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-web) allows UI customization like updating logo, tile aspect ratio, theme, etc. To make these customizations, you can use various environment variables in the env file.

## Change logo

You can use `REACT_APP_LOGO` variable to change your logo in the sample app to customize the UI as per your brand.

**Example:**

```bash
REACT_APP_LOGO='https://example.com/public/logo.svg'
```

## Change tile aspect ratio

You can use the `REACT_APP_TILE_SHAPE` variable to customize the aspect ratio of video tiles; the format is `width-height`.

**Examples:**

-   `REACT_APP_TILE_SHAPE='1-1'`: for square tiles
-   `REACT_APP_TILE_SHAPE='4-3'`: for landscape tiles
-   `REACT_APP_TILE_SHAPE='16-9'`: for wide tiles
-   `REACT_APP_TILE_SHAPE='9-16'`: for mobile view

## Change theme

-   Use the `REACT_APP_THEME` variable to switch the theme between dark and light mode
    -   **Examples:**
        -   `REACT_APP_THEME='dark'`: for dark theme
        -   `REACT_APP_THEME='light'`: for light theme

## Change font

You can use `REACT_APP_FONT` variable to update the font used in the app. The font must be imported in your styling for it to work.

**Example:**

```bash
REACT_APP_FONT='Roboto'
```

## Playlist tracks (watch party)

-   You can play music or videos from a URL for everyone in the room to watch together. The support is only for file formats that are supported by the native audio and video elements, but it's super cool.

-   You can configure the list of audio/video tracks that can be played by a person in the room for everyone as follows:

    -   **Example: Audio playlist**

        ```json
        REACT_APP_AUDIO_PLAYLIST=[
            {
                "name": "Audio1",
                "id": "audio1",
                "metadata": { "description": "Artist1" },
                "url": "https://d2qi07yyjujoxr.cloudfront.net/webapp/playlist/audio1.mp3",
                "type": "audio"
            },
            {
                <details of next audio file>
            }
        ]
        ```

    -   **Example: Video playlist**

        ```json
        REACT_APP_VIDEO_PLAYLIST=[
            {
                "name": "Video2",
                "id": "video2",
                "url": "https://d2qi07yyjujoxr.cloudfront.net/webapp/playlist/video2.mp4",
                "type": "video"
            },
            {
                <details of next video file>
            }
        ]
        ```
