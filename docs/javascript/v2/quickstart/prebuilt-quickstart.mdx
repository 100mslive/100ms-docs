## Prerequisites

-   _React_: Prebuilt is currently available for React application, so basic familiarity with [React](https://reactjs.org/) is required to follow this guide.
-   _100ms account_: You need to have a 100ms account to create a room and get a room-code. You can create a 100ms account [here](https://dashboard.100ms.live/signup).
-   _Room-code_: Prebuilt component requires a room-code to join a room. You can get a room-code for a room using 100ms dashboard. Refer [this](/get-started/v2/get-started/prebuilt/room-codes/overview) guide to learn more about room-codes.

## Start a New React Project

To begin with setting up a new React project, you can follow the steps mentioned in [React Quickstart](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app).
Currently Prebuilt supports Next.js and Create React App with a React version of 17 and above.

Setps to create a new React project using Create React App:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
```

Steps to create a new React project using Next.js:

```bash title="Next.js" {1}
npx create-next-app my-app
cd my-app
```

## Install Roomkit

Roomkit package is available as an npm package. You can install it using the following command:

```bash
npm install @100mslive/roomkit-react --save
```

## Add Prebuilt Component

Once your app is setup using create react app, you can add the Prebuilt component to your app. You can do this by adding the following code to your `App.js` file:

```jsx title="App.js"
import { HMSPrebuilt } from '@100mslive/roomkit-react';

function App() {
    return (
        <div style={{ height: '100%' }}>
            <HMSPrebuilt roomCode="<room-code>" />
        </div>
    );
}
```

For Next.js, you can add the Prebuilt component to your `pages/index.js` file:

```jsx title="pages/index.js"
import { HMSPrebuilt } from '@100mslive/roomkit-react';

export default function Home() {
    return (
        <div style={{ height: '100%' }}>
            <HMSPrebuilt roomCode="<room-code>" />
        </div>
    );
}
```

## Run the App

You can run the app using the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

For NextJS app, you can run the app using the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```
