## Overview

This guide will walk you through the steps to create a video conferencing app using the Prebuilt component of the Roomkit package.
Prebuilt is currently available for React applications, so basic familiarity with [React](https://reactjs.org/) is required to follow this guide.

## Prerequisites

-   _React_: Prebuilt is currently available for React applications, so basic familiarity with [React](https://reactjs.org/) is required to follow this guide.
-   _100ms account_: You need to have a 100ms account to create a room and get a room-code. You can create a 100ms account [here](https://dashboard.100ms.live/signup).
-   _Room-code_: Prebuilt component requires a room-code to join a room. You can get a room-code for a room using the 100ms dashboard. Refer [this](/get-started/v2/get-started/prebuilt/room-codes/overview) guide to learn more about room-codes.

## Start a New React Project

To begin with setting up a new React project, you can follow the steps mentioned in [React Quickstart](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app).
Currently, Prebuilt supports Next.js and Create React App with a React version of 17 and above.

Steps to create a new React project:

<Tabs id="start-project" items={['Create React App', 'Next.js']} />

<Tab id="start-project-0">
```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
```
</Tab>

<Tab id="start-project-1">
```bash title="Next.js" {1}
npx create-next-app my-app
cd my-app
```
</Tab>


## Install Roomkit


The latest version of Roomkit package is available on npm:

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40100mslive%2Froomkit-react.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40100mslive%2Froomkit-react)

You can install it using the following command:

```bash
npm install @100mslive/roomkit-react --save
```

## Add Prebuilt Component

Once your app is setup using create react app, you can add the Prebuilt component to your app.

<Tabs id="add-component" items={['Create React App', 'Next.js']} />

<Tab id="add-component-0">
For Create React App, you can add the Prebuilt component to your `App.js` file:

```jsx title="App.js"
import { HMSPrebuilt } from '@100mslive/roomkit-react';

function App() {
  return (
    <div style={{ height: "100vh" }}>
      <HMSPrebuilt roomCode="<room-code>" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
</Tab>

<Tab id="add-component-1">

For Next.js, you can add the Prebuilt component to your `pages/index.js` file. If you have opted for app router during initialization, you can add the snippet in the `app/page.js` file. Depending on the initialization configuration, the files can be in typescript. The `src` directory is also optional and only affects the file paths:

```jsx title="pages/index.js"
"use client";

import { HMSPrebuilt } from '@100mslive/roomkit-react';

export default function Home() {
    return (
        <div style={{ height: '100vh' }}>
            <HMSPrebuilt roomCode="<room-code>" />
        </div>
    );
}
```
</Tab>

## Run the App
You can run the app using the following command:

<Tabs id="run-app" items={['Create React App', 'Next.js']} />

<Tab id="run-app-0">



```bash
npm start
```

</Tab>

<Tab id="run-app-1">

```bash
npm run dev
```
</Tab>

The Prebuilt component behaves like the 100ms sample app which can be forked from this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-web).
