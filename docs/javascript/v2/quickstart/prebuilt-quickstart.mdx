## Overview

This guide will walk you through the steps to create a video conferencing app using the Prebuilt component of the Roomkit package.
Prebuilt is currently available for React applications, so basic familiarity with [React](https://reactjs.org/) is required to follow this guide.

> If you get stuck at any point or need help in understanding a concept, you can put your query in at support@100ms.live.

## Prerequisites

-   _React_: Prebuilt is currently available for React applications, so basic familiarity with [React](https://reactjs.org/) is required to follow this guide.
-   _100ms account_: You need to have a 100ms account to create a room and get a room-code. You can create a 100ms account [here](https://dashboard.100ms.live/signup).
-   _Room-code_: Prebuilt component requires a room-code to join a room. You can get a room-code for a room using the 100ms dashboard. Refer [this](/get-started/v2/get-started/prebuilt/room-codes/overview) guide to learn more about room-codes.

## Start a New React Project

To begin with setting up a new React project, you can follow the steps mentioned in [React Quickstart](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app).
Currently, Prebuilt supports Next.js and Create React App with a React version of 17 and above.

Steps to create a new React project:

<Tabs id="start-project" items={['Create React App', 'Next.js']} />

<Tab id="start-project-0">
```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
```
</Tab>

<Tab id="start-project-1">
```bash title="Next.js" {1}
npx create-next-app my-app
cd my-app
```
</Tab>


## Install Roomkit


The latest version of Roomkit package is available on npm:

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40100mslive%2Froomkit-react.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40100mslive%2Froomkit-react)

You can install it using the following command:

```bash
npm install @100mslive/roomkit-react --save
```

## Add Prebuilt Component

Once your app is setup using create react app, you can add the Prebuilt component to your app.

<Tabs id="add-component" items={['Create React App', 'Next.js']} />

<Tab id="add-component-0">
For Create React App, you can add the Prebuilt component to your `App.js` file:

```jsx title="App.js"
import { HMSPrebuilt } from '@100mslive/roomkit-react';

function App() {
  return (
    <div style={{ height: "100vh" }}>
      <HMSPrebuilt roomCode="<room-code>" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
</Tab>

<Tab id="add-component-1">

For Next.js, you can add the Prebuilt component to your `pages/index.js` file. If you have opted for app router during initialization, you can add the snippet in the `app/page.js` file. Depending on the initialization configuration, the files can be in typescript. The `src` directory is also optional and only affects the file paths:

```jsx title="pages/index.js"
"use client";

import { HMSPrebuilt } from '@100mslive/roomkit-react';

export default function Home() {
    return (
        <div style={{ height: '100vh' }}>
            <HMSPrebuilt roomCode="<room-code>" />
        </div>
    );
}
```
</Tab>

## Run the App
You can run the app using the following command:

<Tabs id="run-app" items={['Create React App', 'Next.js']} />

<Tab id="run-app-0">



```bash
npm start
```

</Tab>

<Tab id="run-app-1">

```bash
npm run dev
```
</Tab>

## Join a Room

![Join](/docs/v2/prebuilt-room.png)

The Prebuilt component behaves like the 100ms sample app which can be forked from this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-web).

The supported props are listed in the below section.

## Props for HMSPrebuilt

<br />
HMSPrebuilt accepts the following props:

`roomCode` 
- The room code of the room you want to join. You can get the room code from the [100ms dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live).

`logo` (optional)
- An image URL as a string which is displayed in the preview screen and header.

`authToken` (optional)
- This token is room and role specific. It can be copied from the join room modal on the [dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live). Read more about it [here](/get-started/v2/get-started/security-and-tokens#auth-token-for-client-sdks).

`onJoin` (optional)
- A callback function that will be executed after the peer joins the call. 

`onLeave` (optional)
- A callback function that will be executed after the peer leaves the call, the session ends or if the peer gets kicked out.

`options` (optional)
- An object which accepts the following parameters:
    - `userName` (optional): The name to be assigned to the peer.

    - `userId` (optional): The user ID to be assigned to the peer.

## Accessing events, states and more

HMSPrebuilt accepts a ref which is assigned the following:
```js
{
  hmsActions,
  hmsStats,
  hmsStore,
  hmsNotifications,
};
```

You can then listen to events, subscribe to states as required in the parent code.

```jsx
import { selectRoomState } from '@100mslive/hms-video-store';
import { HMSPrebuilt } from '@100mslive/roomkit-react';
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import { getRoomCodeFromUrl } from './utils';

export default function App() {
  const roomCode = getRoomCodeFromUrl();
  const prebuiltRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (prebuiltRef.current) {
      prebuiltRef.current.hmsNotifications.onNotification(msg => console.log(msg));
      prebuiltRef.current.hmsStore.subscribe(currentRoomState => console.log(currentRoomState), selectRoomState);
    }
  }, []);

  return <HMSPrebuilt roomCode={roomCode} ref={prebuiltRef} />;
}
```

## Deploying with customization

To further customize the prebuilt UI, [the repository](https://github.com/100mslive/web-sdks) can be easily forked and edited. The README lists the steps and commands needed for the same, including deployment.
