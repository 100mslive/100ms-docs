## Overview

[100ms-web](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-web) is a fully-featured sample application built using React. This application gives you a ready-made starting point for writing your video apps or customizing the cloned app based on your needs.

You can use this app to test:

-   **Basic functionalities**: Video calling, Recording, Interactive live streaming (HLS), External streaming (RTMP), Screenshare, and Picture-in-Picture (PiP).
-   **Interactive features**: Chat (broadcast, direct, & group), Raise hand.
-   **Plugins**: Virtual background, Collaborative whiteboard, Noise suppression.

The app also includes other features and capabilities like custom audio/video tracks, control remote peers, network quality and performance stats, adaptive bitrate (Simulcast), and more.

Please check our [quickstart guide](./react-quickstart) if you're trying to get started with 100ms with a basic app.

## Set up the app locally

-   Clone the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-web).

    ```bash section=cloneRepo sectionIndex=1
    git clone git@github.com:100mslive/100ms-web.git
    ```

-   Change your working directory to `100ms-web`.

    ```bash section=cloneRepo sectionIndex=2
    cd 100ms-web
    ```

-   Install the dependencies using `npm` or `yarn`.

    ```bash section=cloneRepo sectionIndex=3
    npm install or
    yarn install
    ```

-   Set environment variables to configure token generation endpoint. Use the following command to copy the values from "example.env" to a new file called ".env".

    ```bash section=envVariable sectionIndex=1
    cp example.env .env
    ```

-   Update the 100ms token endpoint as an environment variable to handle auth token generation. You can get your token endpoint from the [Developer section of 100ms' Dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/developer).

    ![token endpoint](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11087313/140727818-43cd8be4-b3bf-4b34-9921-a77f9a1b819d.png)

    **Example**:

    ```bash
    REACT_APP_TOKEN_GENERATION_ENDPOINT = 'https://prod-in2.100ms.live/hmsapi/example.app.100ms.live/'
    ```

## Test the app

-   Start the app with the below command. The app should now be running at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). You should see a welcome message saying, "Almost There!".

    ```bash section=runApp sectionIndex=1
    yarn start
    ```

-   To test audio/video functionality, you need to connect to a 100ms room; please check following steps for the same:

    1. Navigate to your [100ms Dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/dashboard) or [create an account](https://dashboard.100ms.live/register) if you don't have one.
    2. To test this app quickly, use the "Video Conferencing Starter Kit" to create a room with a default template assigned to it.
    3. Go to [Rooms page](https://dashboard.100ms.live/rooms) in your Dashboard, copy the "Room Id" of the room and role created in the above step.
    4. Add the "Room Id" and role to the localhost URL to test the app. For example, `http://localhost:3000/633fcdd84208780bf665346a/host`

    <br />
    <video loop="true" autoplay="autoplay" controls="controls" id="vid" muted>
        <source src="/docs/guides/join-room-sample-app.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
    <br />

## Customize your app

This sample app allows UI customization, like updating the UI layout, logo, tile aspect ratio, theme, color, etc. To make these customizations, you can use various environment variables in the env file.

### Configure UI layout

-   You can customize the layout to arrange the position of video tiles based on roles. The value of `REACT_APP_POLICY_CONFIG` should be a JSON stringified object of the structure:

    ```ts section=configureUi sectionIndex=1
    type HMSRoleName = string;

    /**
     * undefined means none
     * empty array [] for all roles
     */
    interface RoleConfig {
        center?: HMSRoleName[];
        sidepane?: HMSRoleName[];
        selfRoleChangeTo?: HMSRoleName[];
        remoteRoleChangeFor?: HMSRoleName[];
    }

    interface PolicyConfig {
        [role: string]: RoleConfig;
    }
    ```

-   **Example**: If you wish to keep the video tile of the student in the center for the trainer and his video tile on the side pane, you can use the below JSON stringified object.

    ```bash
    REACT_APP_POLICY_CONFIG = "{"trainer":{"center": ["student"],"sidepane":["trainer"]}}"
    ```

### Change logo

You can upload your logo in the sample app to customize the UI for your brand. You can achieve this in two ways:

-   Using the no-code editor in the UI

    <video loop="true" autoplay="autoplay" controls="controls" id="vid" muted>
        <source src="/docs/guides/logo.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
    <br />

-   Adding the image URL in `REACT_APP_LOGO` variable in the .env file.

### Change tile aspect ratio

You can use the `REACT_APP_TILE_SHAPE` variable to customize the aspect ratio of video tiles; the format is `width-height`.

**Examples:**

-   `1-1`: square tiles
-   `4-3`: landscape tiles
-   `16-9`: wide tiles
-   `9:16`: mobile view

### Change theme and color

-   Use the `REACT_APP_THEME` variable to switch the theme between dark and light mode
    -   `dark`: for dark theme
    -   `light`: for light theme
-   Use the `REACT_APP_COLOR` variable to customize the UI with your brand colors
    -   You can give a hex code the color will be used for buttons, border audio level and such.

### Change font

You can use `REACT_APP_FONT` variable to update the font used in the app. The font must be imported in your styling for it to work.

### Enable/disable chat and screenshare

-   You can set the `REACT_APP_SHOW_CHAT` variable as "false" to disable chat
-   Set `REACT_APP_SHOW_SCREENSHARE` variable as "false" to disable screenshare

> Note: Like [changing logo](#change-logo) using the no-code editor, you can update the theme, brand color, font, tile aspect ratio and download the `env` file from the 100ms demo app links and use it.

### Playlist tracks (watch party)

-   You can play music or videos from a URL for everyone in the room to watch together. The support is only for file formats that are supported by the native audio and video elements, but it's super cool.

-   You can configure the list of audio/video tracks that can be played by a person in the room for everyone as follows:

    -   `REACT_APP_AUDIO_PLAYLIST`: &lt;audio tracks&gt;
    -   `REACT_APP_VIDEO_PLAYLIST`: &lt;video tracks&gt;
