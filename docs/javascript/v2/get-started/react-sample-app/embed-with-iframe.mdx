## Overview

If you want a quick integration of a fully featured video conferencing/live streaming app inside your application within a day, iframe is the way to go.

Some of the benefits of iframe integration are:

-   You can have a fully-featured video conferencing/live streaming UI added to your web app with minimal development
-   You can customize to a greatest extent as per your requirements
-   You can use this in the framework you're already using in your app
-   Using an iframe you can embed the whole sample web app inside your UI wherever you want

## Implementation

As discussed in the [Build and deploy guide](/javascript/v2/get-started/react-sample-app/build-and-deploy), you can fork and deploy our [sample web app](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-web/) and use that URL in an iframe.

```html
<iframe
    title="100ms-app"
    allow="camera *;microphone *;display-capture *"
    src="<your-deployed-url-here>"
    style="height: 900px; width: 900px;"
></iframe>
```

Adding and testing the iframe in a simple web app:

-   Create a HTML file in an editor, copy the below example code and paste in the file
-   Use the Room Id and role of one of the rooms from your [Dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/rooms)
-   Save the HTML and load it in your browser. You should now see the app in action.

**Example**

```html
<html>
    <body>
        <iframe
            title="100ms-app"
            allow="camera *;microphone *;display-capture *"
            src="https://lambent-nougat-3c526c.netlify.app/633fcdd84208780bf665346a/host"
            style="height: 900px; width: 900px"
        ></iframe>
    </body>
</html>
```

-   "https://lambent-nougat-3c526c.netlify.app" - application URL
-   "633fcdd84208780bf665346a" - Room Id
-   "host" - role name
