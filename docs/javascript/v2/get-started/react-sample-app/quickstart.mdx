## Overview

[100ms-web](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-web) is a fully-featured sample application built using React. This application gives you a ready-made starting point for writing your video apps or customizing the cloned app based on your needs.

You can use this app to test:

-   **Basic functionalities**: Video calling, Recording, Interactive live streaming (HLS), External streaming (RTMP), Screenshare, and Picture-in-Picture (PiP).
-   **Interactive features**: Chat (broadcast, direct, & group), Raise hand.
-   **Plugins**: Virtual background, Collaborative whiteboard, Noise suppression.

The app also includes other features and capabilities like custom audio/video tracks, control remote peers, network quality and performance stats, adaptive bitrate (Simulcast), and more.

This guide and the upcoming guides related to the sample app will enable you to build and deploy a fully-featured video conferencing/live streaming app.

If you are a developer trying to build an app from scratch, please check our [quickstart guide](./react-quickstart). You can follow the journey of building a simple video conferencing app from scratch.

## Local development

    descriptions={[
        'Clone the sample app repo and set it up on your local development environment.',

<StepsContainer id="local-development">

### Set up the app repo

-   Clone the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-web).

    ```bash section=cloneRepo sectionIndex=1
    git clone git@github.com:100mslive/100ms-web.git
    ```

-   Change your working directory to `100ms-web`.

    ```bash section=cloneRepo sectionIndex=2
    cd 100ms-web
    ```

-   Install the dependencies using `npm` or `yarn`.

    ```bash section=cloneRepo sectionIndex=3
    npm install or
    yarn install
    ```

### Configure auth token endpoint

-   Set environment variables to configure token generation endpoint. Use the following command to copy the values from "example.env" to a new file called ".env".

    ```bash section=envVariable sectionIndex=1
    cp example.env .env
    ```

-   Update the 100ms token endpoint as an environment variable to handle auth token generation. You can get your token endpoint from the [Developer section of 100ms' Dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/developer).

    ![token endpoint](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11087313/140727818-43cd8be4-b3bf-4b34-9921-a77f9a1b819d.png)

    **Example**:

    ```bash
    REACT_APP_TOKEN_GENERATION_ENDPOINT = 'https://prod-in2.100ms.live/hmsapi/example.app.100ms.live/'
    ```

### Start and test the app

#### Start the app

-   Start the app with the below command.

    ```bash section=runApp sectionIndex=1
    npm start or
    yarn start
    ```

-   The app should now be running at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). You should see a welcome message saying, "Almost There!".

#### Create and join a room

-   To test audio/video functionality, you need to connect to a 100ms room; please check following steps for the same:

    1. Navigate to your [100ms Dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/dashboard) or [create an account](https://dashboard.100ms.live/register) if you don't have one.
    2. To test this app quickly, use the "Video Conferencing Starter Kit" to create a room with a default template assigned to it.
    3. Go to [Rooms page](https://dashboard.100ms.live/rooms) in your Dashboard, copy the "Room Id" of the room and role created in the above step.
    4. Add the "Room Id" and role to the localhost URL to test the app. For example, `http://localhost:3000/633fcdd84208780bf665346a/host`

## Next steps

#### [Code structure](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-web/wiki/code-structure)

Check the overall project structure of the sample app to understand how the code is organized and understand various components of the app.

#### [Building and deployment](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-web/wiki/Building-and-deployment)

Building and deploying the 100ms sample app is simple and the same as any React project. You can deploy this to Vercel, Netlify, AWS, Web server, Docker, etc., as you prefer.

#### [Simple quickstart](./react-quickstart)

Please check our [quickstart guide](./react-quickstart) if you're trying to get started with 100ms with a basic app.

#### [Server-side APIs](/docs/server-side/v2/introduction/basics)

You can use server-side APIs to programmatically create/update rooms and templates, control peers, record, live stream, and more.
