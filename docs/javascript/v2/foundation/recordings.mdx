Recordings are an important part of the live video stack as they convert the live, ephemeral content into a long-term asset. But the use of this asset varies from business to business depending on their respective use case.

For e.g, one of the common use cases for recording is for archival purposes versus, for some, its content to be publicised.

Based on your end goal, you can choose one of the recording types and its implementation. You can understand some key differences using the comparison table below.

## Browser Recording [Recommended]

Browser recording is built to give users a participant-first recording experience. When enabled, our browser-based bot Beam joins a meeting or a stream to record the room just like any other participant. The output is an MP4 file that captures the room's published audio/video tracks together into one single file. This option removes the complexity of syncing various audio/video tracks and offers an intuitive, participant-first recording experience.

**Use cases:** Archival Recording, Record a Sales Meeting, Record an ongoing Live Stream, Record a Class, etc.

## SFU Recording [Advanced]

SFU recording is built for advanced use cases where users want individual audio and video tracks for each participant. This recording option allows you to isolate recording at a participant level. Track recording allows you to record audio and video streams separately, making it easier to edit, layer, or reuse each of them.

You can get track recordings in two forms:

-   Individual: Media for each peer is provided as a separate mp4 file. This file will have both audio and video of the peer. These files can be used for offline review or in implementing custom composition.

-   Composite [currently has known Issues]: Audio and video of all peers are composed as per their joining/leaving the meeting and provided as a single mp4. This file can be used for offline viewing of the meeting.

**e.g.** Recording a live podcast, recording for rooms with very high number of participants, etc.

## VOD Recording

Video on-demand recording is available for our Interactive Live Streaming product. This recording will be a file with an M3U8 file (same playback format as HLS), which can be used for replaying your HLS stream. This option is more suitable for Video-on-Demand use cases. For the implementation of this type of recording, please contact us [here](https://www.100ms.live/contact).

## Multiresolution Recording

A multiresolution recording is available for interactive live-streaming offering. This type of recording will have a multi-file structure for all available resolutions of the stream. The output will be multiple MP4 files with these resolutions: 240p, 480p, 720p and 1080p. For an implementation of this type of recording, please contact us [here](https://www.100ms.live/contact).

## Recording Storage

Storage for your recordings can be configured via Destinations in your template settings. Our current offering allows you to store your recordings in Amazon S3 buckets. Once you configure the S3 config of your bucket in a template, all respective recordings of sessions created via those templates will be sent to your configured bucket. This holds true for all types of aforementioned recordings.

## How to configure recording storage?

1. Generate your credentials, for this example, you can check out a guide **[here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html)**. You can skip this step if you already have credentials. Please note that if you are running Browser recording you need to give just upload permission to your keys, but if you are running SFU recordings, you need to give both upload and download permission.

2. Go to 100ms Dashboard and go to template **configuration by selecting the settings icon**.

3. Head over to the **Destinations** tab.

4. Key in your credentials like (using an example of an S3 bucket here):

`Access Key: (Access Key generated from AWS IAM Console) `Secret Key: (Access Key generated from AWS IAM Console)
`Bucket: Name of the bucket in S3 `Region: Name of the region e.g ap-south1
`Prefix for Upload Path: You can use this option to configure the upload path in your bucket

5. Use the **Validate Config** button to test your storage setup.

6. You will see a message that the AWS **configuration was successfully validated.**

The above message ensures that your configuration is successful now, and all your recordings will start collecting in your configured destination.
