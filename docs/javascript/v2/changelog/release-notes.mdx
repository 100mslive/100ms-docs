interface HMSRole {
    name: string;
    publishParams: PublishParams;
    subscribeParams: {
        subscribeToRoles: string[],
        maxSubsBitRate: number
    };
    permissions: {
        endRoom: boolean,
        removeOthers: boolean,
        stopPresentation: boolean,
        muteAll: boolean,
        askToUnmute: boolean,
        muteSelective: boolean,
        changeRole: boolean
    };
    priority: number;
}

export interface PublishParams {
    audio: {
        bitRate: number,
        codec: string
    };
    video: {
        bitRate: number,
        codec: string,
        frameRate: number,
        width: number,
        height: number

        codec: string,
        frameRate: number,
        width: number,
        height: number
    };
    allowed: string[];
}
