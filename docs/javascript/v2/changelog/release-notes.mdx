#### Added

## 2023-03-31

Released: `@100mslive/hms-video-store@0.10.0`, `@100mslive/react-sdk@0.8.0`

#### Added
- alpha release of `@100mslive/hls-player` is done.
 `@100mslive/hls-player` is currently a wrapper on hls.js with easy to use interface and few add-ons for [100ms's interactive live streaming feature](../how--to-guides/record-and-live-stream/hls/hls).

#### Fixed:
- SDK causing memory exception in preview when room state peer list is enabled for 1500+ peers.
- All servers setting `isTerminal: true` on the `HMSException`. Now only the terminal server errors will set `isTerminal: true`
- Analytics events

#### Breaking:
- [`getAuthTokenByRoomCode`](/api-reference/javascript/v2/interfaces/HMSActions#getauthtokenbyroomcode) in hmsActions now returns the token as a string in response.

## 2023-03-14

Released: `@100mslive/hms-video-store@0.9.0`, `@100mslive/react-sdk@0.7.0`

#### Added:
- [`getAuthTokenByRoomCode`](/api-reference/javascript/v2/interfaces/HMSActions#getauthtokenbyroomcode) in hmsActions to get token for room short code.
- The SDK now handles auto subscribing/unsubscribing while [rendering video](../how--to-guides/set-up-video-conferencing/render-video/overview) based on the element's visibility. If Simulcast is enabled, the appropriate resolution based on the video element's dimensions will also be auto-selected. Note that this was already available for react-sdk via the useVideo hook. With this release, we've also added it for the core SDK.

#### Breaking:
- SDK now handles subscribing and unsubscribing to video based on the element's visibility. If you're using hmsActions.detachVideo function to unsubscribe to video for e.g. when it's not visible, you may have to pass the flag `autoManageVideo: false` in join config. This will avoid any conflict between SDK and your app's code by disabling SDK's functionality. For more details, please check our docs for [rendering video](../how--to-guides/set-up-video-conferencing/render-video/overview).

// Before
peer.role; // returns a string

// After
peer.role; // returns HMSRole

interface HMSRole {
    name: string;
    publishParams: PublishParams;
    subscribeParams: {
        subscribeToRoles: string[],
        maxSubsBitRate: number
    };
    permissions: {
        endRoom: boolean,
        removeOthers: boolean,
        stopPresentation: boolean,
        muteAll: boolean,
        askToUnmute: boolean,

}

export interface PublishParams {
    audio: {
        bitRate: number,
        codec: string
    };
    video: {
        bitRate: number,
        codec: string,
        frameRate: number,

        height: number
    };
    allowed: string[];
