Released: `@100mslive/hms-video-store@0.10.12`, `@100mslive/react-sdk@0.8.12`, `@100mslive/hls-player@0.1.12`

## Important 

Starting from version `0.10.12` of `@100mslive/hms-video-store` and version `0.8.12` of `@100mslive/react-sdk`: <br/>
When using [room-composite browser recording](/javascript/v2/how-to-guides/record-and-live-stream/rtmp-recording) (formerly *beam recording*), [RTMP stream](/javascript/v2/how-to-guides/record-and-live-stream/rtmp-recording) or [HLS stream](/javascript/v2/how-to-guides/record-and-live-stream/hls/hls) with `meetingURL` using the specified or a newer SDK version:
- `beam` (bot peer) won't appear in the peers' list on all platforms (Web, Android, and iOS)
- [Peer webhook events](/server-side/v2/how-to-guides/configure-webhooks/webhook#peer-events) like `peer.join.success` and `peer.leave.success` won't be sent for the `beam` peer.
- [Beam webhook events](/server-side/v2/how-to-guides/configure-webhooks/webhook#rtmp-streaming-browser-recording-events) like `beam.started.success` will still be sent.
- No need to explain the presence of an extra peer (`beam`).
<br/> We highly recommend you to update any business logic dependent on beam's *peer webhook events* and instead use *[beam webhook events](/server-side/v2/how-to-guides/configure-webhooks/webhook#rtmp-streaming-browser-recording-events)*.

### Fixed:

## 2023-03-31

Released: `@100mslive/hms-video-store@0.10.0`, `@100mslive/react-sdk@0.8.0`

#### Added
- alpha release of `@100mslive/hls-player` is done.
 `@100mslive/hls-player` is currently a wrapper on hls.js with easy to use interface and few add-ons for [100ms's interactive live streaming feature](../how--to-guides/record-and-live-stream/hls/hls).

#### Fixed:
- SDK causing memory exception in preview when room state peer list is enabled for 1500+ peers.
- All servers setting `isTerminal: true` on the `HMSException`. Now only the terminal server errors will set `isTerminal: true`
- Analytics events

#### Breaking:
- [`getAuthTokenByRoomCode`](/api-reference/javascript/v2/interfaces/HMSActions#getauthtokenbyroomcode) in hmsActions now returns the token as a string in response.

## 2023-03-14

Released: `@100mslive/hms-video-store@0.9.0`, `@100mslive/react-sdk@0.7.0`

#### Added:
- [`getAuthTokenByRoomCode`](/api-reference/javascript/v2/interfaces/HMSActions#getauthtokenbyroomcode) in hmsActions to get token for room short code.
- The SDK now handles auto subscribing/unsubscribing while [rendering video](../how--to-guides/set-up-video-conferencing/render-video/overview) based on the element's visibility. If Simulcast is enabled, the appropriate resolution based on the video element's dimensions will also be auto-selected. Note that this was already available for react-sdk via the useVideo hook. With this release, we've also added it for the core SDK.

#### Breaking:
- SDK now handles subscribing and unsubscribing to video based on the element's visibility. If you're using hmsActions.detachVideo function to unsubscribe to video for example when it's not visible, you may have to pass the flag `autoManageVideo: false` in join config. This will avoid any conflict between SDK and your app's code by disabling SDK's functionality. For more details, please check our docs for [rendering video](../how--to-guides/set-up-video-conferencing/render-video/overview).

## 2023-02-22

- Network interruption during join

- In some chrome versions, default devices are not prefixed with default- which is resulting in device not being selected on device change
- Make error in `setRemoteDescription` terminal
- Browser tab showing indicator that mic is active even when audio disabled
- `No sender found` log while stopping playlist
