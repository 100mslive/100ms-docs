Any peer can change their own name before or after joining a room.
Before joining, the name would have to be specified in `HMSConfig` that is passed to the join method.
After joining, name can be changed with this call to hmsActions -

```
await hmsActions.changeName(newName);
```

The store will update on the remote side, and as a result corresponding UI will also be updated automatically.
A notification of type `HMSNotificationTypes.NAME_UPDATED` will also be sent in case a toast needs to be presented.
