Preview screen is a frequently used UX element which allows users to check if their input devices are working properly and 
set the initial state (mute/unmute) of their audio and video tracks before joining. 
100ms SDKs provide an easy-to-use API to back this feature. 
Additionally, the SDK will try to establish a connection to 100ms server to verify there are no network issues and that the 
auth credentials are valid so that if everything is in order the subsequent room join is instant.

To invoke this API call

```js
hmsActions.preview(config)
```

You would need the same config object that you would pass to [join API](Join). The interface to render video, mute/unmute etc. remains the same.
