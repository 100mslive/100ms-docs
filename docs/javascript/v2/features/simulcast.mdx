Simulcast is a technique by which a WebRTC client(publisher) encodes the same video stream multipe times in different resolutions and bitrates and sends these to the server(SFU) who then decides who(subscriber) receives which of the published resolutions.

To turn on simulcast in your room, open the [templates](https://dashboard.100ms.live/templates) in the dashboard and enable it for roles there.

## Setting Simulcast Layer

Available simulcast layers are:
- HMSSimulcastLayer.HIGH
- HMSSimulcastLayer.MEDIUM
- HMSSimulcastLayer.LOW

> Note: The number of layers available will be dependent on the video publish resolution for the role in template settings in the dashboard.

Action to update the layer:

```jsx
import { HMSSimulcastLayer } from '@100mslive/hms-video-store';
/*
 * layer can be one of:
 * HMSSimulcastLayer.HIGH
 * HMSSimulcastLayer.MEDIUM
 * HMSSimulcastLayer.LOW
 */
hmsActions.setPreferredLayer(<videoTrackID>, layer);
```

## Layer selection based on Video Element's Dimension:

When using `useVideo` hook from our [react sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@100mslive/react-sdk) the relevant simulcast layer is automatically subscribed to, based on the video tile size if simulcast is enabled from the dahsboard template.


## Simulcast fields on the track

The [HMSVideoTrack](/api-reference/javascript/v2/interfaces/HMSVideoTrack) has a few fields related to simulcast.

- `layer` - is the current layer you are receiving from the server
- `layerDefinitions` - are the available layers for the role based on the template. These will contain layer name and resolution(widthxheight).
- `preferredLayer` - this will contain the layer that is either manually set or auto selected based on resolution.
