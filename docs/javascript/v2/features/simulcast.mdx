Sometimes people have bad internet connections but everyone deserves a good meeting.

Simulcast is a mechanism of publishing mutiple video layers, so the subscribers can subscribe what their bandwidth supports. This helps in having a video for most
people in the room even with low bandwidth by subscribing to a lower quality layer.

If the network quality improves, the high quality layer can be subscribed.

To turn on simulcast in your room, open the [templates](https://dashboard.100ms.live/templates) in the dashboard and enable it for roles there.


## Responding in the app

When using our `useVideo` hook from our `@100mslive/react-sdk` the relevant simulcast layer is subscribed to, based on the video tile size.

if you are not using our react-sdk, you can use the following method to set your preferred layer to subscribe to:

```jsx

hmsActions.setPreferredLayer(<videoTrackID>, layer);

```
By default, it is subscribed to high quality layer(`HMSSimulatorLayer.HIGH`). if you want to customise the layer, you can call the above function with relevant layer.

Note: The number of layers available will be dependent on the template settings in the dashboard.

The [HMSVideoTrack](/api-reference/javascript/v2/interfaces/HMSVideoTrack) has a few fields related to simulcast.

- `layer` - is the current layer you are receiving from the server
- `layerDefinitions` - are the available layers for the role based on the template. These will contain layer name and resolution(widthxheight).
- `preferredLayer` - this will contain the layer that is either manually set or autoselected.
