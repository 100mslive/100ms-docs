Want to preserve your video call for posterity in a recording?
Or live stream it out to millions of viewers on twitch, wowza, facebook, youtube or whatever gives you an RTMP ingest URL?

Turn on RTMP streaming or recording!

In 100ms, recording and streaming is usually achieved by having a bot join your room
and stream what it sees and hears to a file (recording) or to an rtmp ingest url (streaming).
It's also possible to start streaming and recording from [server side APIs](/server-side/v2/features/rtmp-streaming-and-browser-recording).

>There is another type
 of SFU based recording as well which allows for all the tracks to be recorded individually, you can find more details about it
 [here](/server-side/v2/features/recording).


## Starting and Stopping streaming / recording

These are the options which need to be passed to start rtmp or recording -
1. **meetingUrl**: *string*. The url the 100ms bot user will open to join your room. It must allow access without any user level interaction.
2. **rtmpUrls**: *string[]*. Optional, if streaming is required, this has to be one or more RTMP Ingest Urls where the stream should go.
3. **record**: *bool*. Optional, If recording is required this can be set as true. This value has no effect on streaming.


* If both rtmpUrls and record = true are provided, both streaming and recording will begin.
* If only rtmpUrls are provided, only streaming will begin.
* If only record true is provided, only recording will begin.

If either one is started, the other can't be started without first stopping whatever is running.
Eg: Only streaming is started. Recording can't be started unless streaming is stopped first.

If both are required, they have to be started together by providing both RTMP Ingest Urls and recording = true.

```js
async start() {
    const params = {
        meetingUrl: "",
        rtmpUrls: "",
        record: true
    };
    try {
        await hmsActions.startRTMPOrRecording(params);
    } catch(err) {
        console.error("failed to start rtmp/recording", err);
    }
}

async stop() {
    try {
        await hmsActions.stopRTMPAndRecording();
    } catch (err) {
        console.error("failed to stop rtmp/recording", err);
    }
}

```

## Current Recording/RTMP State

As it is with everything else in the 100ms web world, we've selectors to tell us about the current state of the room,
whether recording or streaming is already going on and if recording is happening, which type of recording is currently running.

```js
const recordingState = hmsStore.getState(selectRecordingState);
const rtmpState = hmsStore.getState(selectRTMPState);

console.log("is sfu recording going on - ", recordingState.server.running);
console.log("is browser recording going on - ", recordingState.browser.running);
console.log("is streaming going on - ", rtmpState.running);
```
