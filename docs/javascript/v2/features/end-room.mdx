Done with talking and it's time to end the call for everyone not just yourself? You may be looking to end the room.

### Permissions

Can't let just anyone end a call. First you need to create a [role](../foundation/templates-and-roles) with the permissions to end a room.

The permission to end a room is called `endRoom` and you should check for that within the [HMSRole.permissions](../../../api-reference/javascript/v2/interfaces/HMSRole#permissions) of the peer to see if they have it.

Use the [selectPermissions](../../../api-reference/javascript/v2/home/content#select-permissions) selector to check whether the local peer has the permission to end the room.

### Ending the Room

Once you're sure the peer has the permissions to end the room they can call for the room to end when they're ready with `hmsActions.endRoom`.

`endRoom` takes two parameters.

`lock`: Whether you want to prevent anyone from rejoining the room. If false, they will be allowed to enter the room again if the client called `join`. If this is false, they will not able to join this room again.

`reason`: The message you want to show people when they are forced to leave. This is a good place to thank them for joining the call and informing them that it has ended.

> ðŸ’¡ After calling endRoom the local peer needs to dispose of the video calling UI as well.

```js
function renderEndRoomButton(permissions) {
    const endRoomButton = document.getElementById('end-room-button');

    if (permissions.endRoom) {
        endRoomButton.addEventListener('click', function () {
            hmsActions.endRoom(lock, 'Reason goes here');
        });
        endRoomButton.style.display = 'inline-block';
    } else {
        endRoomButton.style.display = 'none';
    }
}

// subscribe to the permissions, so render is called whenever there is a change due to role change
hmsStore.subscribe(renderEndRoomButton, selectPermissions);
```

</Tab>

<Tab id='endroomcall-1'>

```jsx
function EndRoomButton() {
    const permissions = useHMSStore(selectPermissions);
    const hmsActions = useHMSActions();

    return permissions.endRoom ? (
        <button onClick={() => hmsActions.endRoom(lock, 'Reason goes here')}>End Room</button>
    ) : null;
}
```

</Tab>

### Handling end room by a remote peer

Once the peer with adequate permissions calls `endRoom`, all other peers in the room will receive a [notification](../features/notifications) with type `ROOM_ENDED` with a [HMSLeaveRoomRequest](../../../api-reference/javascript/v2/interfaces/HMSLeaveRoomRequest) object as the data.

The SDK automatically calls leave and performs necessary clean ups 2 seconds from the moment this notification is sent, clients should show the appropriate UI(show a toast, redirect to a 'good-bye' page) within this period.
