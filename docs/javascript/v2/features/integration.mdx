## Installing our libraries

You can use either npm or yarn to install the dependencies. Please install the respective libraries depending on whether
you're planning to use with react or other framework/plain JavaScript.

<Tabs id="packages-install" items={['JavaScript', 'React']} />

<Tab id="packages-install-0">

```bash
npm install --save @100mslive/hms-video @100mslive/hms-video-store
```

</Tab>

<Tab id="packages-install-1">

```bash
npm install --save @100mslive/hms-video @100mslive/hms-video-react
```

</Tab>

## Setting up the sdk

Our core SDK can be used with plain JavaScript or any UI framework. We also provide a convenient hooks based interface
in case you're planning to integrate our SDK in a React app. Please follow the appropriate section below.

### JavaScript

There are three entities which we need to be familiar of -

* `hmsStore` - this contains the complete state of the room at any given time. This includes for example, participant details,
messages and track states.
* `hmsActions` - this is used to perform any action such as joining, muting and sending a message.
* `hmsNotifications` - this can be used to get notified on peer join/leave and new messages in order to show toast notifications to
the user.

Let's create a `hms.js` file where we initialize and export the above entities, so they can be used as required. We'll assume that
this setup is in place in other sections of the documentation.

<Tabs id="store" items={['Setup and Export', 'Import and use']} />{' '}

<Tab id='store-0'>

```js:hms.js
import { HMSReactiveStore } from '@100mslive/hms-video-store';

const hms = new HMSReactiveStore();

// by default subscriber is notified about store changes post subscription only, this can be
// changed to call it right after subscribing too using this function.
hmsManager.triggerOnSubscribe(); // optional, recommended

const hmsActions = hms.getHMSActions();
const hmsStore = hms.getStore();
const hmsNotifications = hms.getNotifications();

export { hmsActions, hmsStore, hmsNotifications };
```

</Tab>

<Tab  id='store-1'>

```js:some_other_file.js
import { hmsActions, hmsStore, hmsNotifications } from './hms';
```

</Tab>

### React Hooks

If you're planning to use our SDK with React, we provide three friendly hooks as a wrapper over our plain JavaScript interface.
You can wrap your UI in `HMSRoomProvider` and these hooks will become available to all the UI components. We'll learn more about these hooks,
and their use as we navigate through further sections.

<Tabs id="react" items={['Wrap In Provider', 'Use hooks']} />{' '}

<Tab id='react-0'>

```jsx:app.jsx
import { HMSRoomProvider } from '@100mslive/hms-video-react';

export function App() {
  return (
    <HMSRoomProvider>
      <MyApp />
    </HMSRoomProvider>
  );
}

```
</Tab>

<Tab  id='react-1'>


```jsx:component.jsx
import {
  useHMSStore,
  useHMSActions,
  useHMSNotifications
} from '@100mslive/hms-video-react';

export function MyComponent() {
  const hmsStore = useHMSStore();
  const hmsActions = useHMSActions();
  const hmsNotifications = useHMSNotifications();

  return </>;
}
```

## Debugging Tools

We believe that debugging is an important aspect of a developer first SDK.
We have designed our APIs and error messages with developer experience and ease of debugging in mind. We hope that
you'll have a delightful experience walking through the features and integrating our sdk in your app. Our core sdk
is written in Typescript, so all the typings are included with the SDK and are guaranteed to be true. This means that,
even if you use JavaScript, editors will be able to give a significantly improved experience in terms of intellisense.

We take the debugging experience one step further by connecting our store to redux devtools extension out of box. This gives you transparency and
visibility into the whole room state while building your UI.
We highly recommend installing the [devtools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en)
extension to visualize this state along with all the activities taking place in a single view. This makes it easier
to understand when and how the UI should change. You can use the time travel feature of the redux devtools
to recreate state changes for debugging specific issues as well.

We also give a ready to use UI without writing any code which can be accessed
from the [dashboard account](https://dashboard.100ms.live). The code for this sample is open sourced [here](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-web).
You can either start with this codebase or write your own, and use it for testing your webapp
in the initial phase of development.
