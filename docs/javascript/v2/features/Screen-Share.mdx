title: Screen Share
---

To be able to share your screen, you should have screenshare enabled from the dashboard for your role.

Once your role has permissions to share screen, do the following: 

To start screenshare:
```
hmsSDK.startScreenShare(onStop);
/* onStop is the callback called if user stops the screenshare
  from the system prompt */
```

Screenshare with Audio:
 - This is currently supported only in chrome and only while sharing a tab
 - You can also share audio from screenshare by selecting a tab that has an audio while sharing the screen. 
    (Don't forget to check the checkbox at bottom left while doing this for the audio to be shared.)

To stop the screenshare:

```
hmsSDK.stopScreenShare();
```
