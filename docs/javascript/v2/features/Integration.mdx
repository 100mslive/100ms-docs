## Setting up the sdk

### Vanilla Javascript


### React Hooks

If you're planning to use our SDK with React, we also provide hms specific hooks as a wrapper over our javascript methods. These
hooks make it even more convenient to access data and perform any action.


## Debugging Tools

We have designed our APIs and error messages with developer experience and ease of debugging in mind.

We take this one step further by connecting our store to redux devtools extension if it is available. This gives you transparency and
visibility into the whole room state sdk currently has while building your UI.
We highly recommend installing [redux devtools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en)
extension to visualize this state along with all the activities taking place in a single view. This makes it easier
to understand when and how the UI should change. You can also use the powerful time travel feature of the redux devtools
to recreate state changes for debugging specific issues.

> Note that the integration is available even if you use our javascript sdk directly, react is not needed for this.
