title: Join Room
nav: 3.02
---

To join and interact with others in audio or video call, the user needs to join a `room`.

When user indicates that they want to _join_ the room, your app should have -
1. User Name - the name which should be displayed to other peers in the room.
2. [Authentication Token](../guides/token) - the client side authentication token generated by the Token Service.

You can also optionally pass these fields -
1. settings: {isAudioMuted, isVideoMuted} - you can use this to set the initial audio/video state at time of join.
2. User metadata - this can be used to pass any additional metadata associated with the user.

We'll call the `join` method on `hmsActions` object with a config containing above fields to join the room.


<Tabs id="join" items={['Javascript', 'React']} />{' '}

<Tab id='join-0'>

```js:join.js
import { hmsActions } from './hms';

const config = {
    userName: 'Jon Snow',
    authToken: '<Auth token>', // client-side token generated from your token service
    settings: {
        isAudioMuted: true,
        isVideoMuted: false
    },
    metaData: JSON.stringify({city: 'Winterfell', knowledge: 'nothing'})
};

hmsActions.join(config);

```

</Tab>

<Tab  id='join-1'>

```jsx:join.jsx
import { useHMSActions } from '@100mslive/hms-video-react';

function Join() {
  const hmsActions = useHMSActions();

  const config = {
    userName: 'Jon Snow',
    authToken: '<Auth token>', // client-side token generated from your token service
    settings: {
        isAudioMuted: true,
        isVideoMuted: false
    },
    metaData: JSON.stringify({city: 'Winterfell', knowledge: 'nothing'})
  };

  function onJoinClick() {
    hmsActions.join(config)
  }

  return <
        // form with input and join button
  />;
}
```

</Tab>

That's it. You have joined a room successfully ðŸ¥³. You should now be able to have an audio only call with this.

## Getting Current Room State

You might want to hide your join form from the UI or navigate to another page when the join has completed.
We provide some selectors which operate upon the room state to give the relevant information. One such
selector is `selectIsConnectedToRoom`. Here's how to use it -

<Tabs id="connected" items={['Javascript', 'React']} />{' '}

<Tab id='connected-0'>


```js
import { hmsStore } from './hms';
import { selectIsConnectedToRoom } from '@100mslive/hms-video-store';

// use getState to get the state at any time
console.log("isConnected - ", hmsStore.getState(selectIsConnectedToRoom))

function onRoomStateChange(connected) {
    console.log("isConnected - ", connected)
}

// you can also subscribe to the state and get your function called whenever the state changes
hmsStore.subscribe(onRoomStateChange, selectIsConnectedToRoom)

```

</Tab>

<Tab  id='connected-1'>

```jsx
import { useHMSStore, selectIsConnectedToRoom } from '@100mslive/hms-video-react';

// if the connection state changes, the store hook will take care of rerendering the component
function ConnectionState() {
    const isConnected = useHMSStore(selectIsConnectedToRoom)

    return <div>{ isConnected ? "connected" : "not connected, please join." }</div>
}
```

</Tab>
