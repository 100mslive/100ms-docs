PIP allows the users to see a mini window with video while navigating to other tabs on the browser.

100ms PIP selects top 4 peers with video enabled and render them in the PIP window.


For implemenation copy this [folder](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-web/tree/main/src/components/PIP) to your react project.

```jsx
import { PIP } from '../path-to-above-folder';

function SomeComponent() {
    return (
        <PIP />
    )
}
```
For non React projects, you can use `PictureInPicture` from PIPManager in the above folder and use it to start/stop pip, check whether 
it is supported or not.

## Customisation:

If you want to render custom peers in PIP from your end, you can pass those peers in the `PIPComponent` in the above folder.
