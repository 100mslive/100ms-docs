Sometimes people have bad internet connections but everyone deserves a good meeting.

When the network is too slow to support audio and video conversations together, the 100ms SDK can automatically turn off downloading other peer's videos, which may improve the audio quality and avoid disconnections.

If the network quality improves, the videos will be restored automatically as well.

To turn on subscribe degradation in your room, open the [templates](https://dashboard.100ms.live/templates) in the dashboard and enable it for roles there.

## Responding in the app

The [HMSTrack](/api-reference/javascript/v2/interfaces/HMSTrack#degraded) object has a boolean `degraded` field which will
become true if the track gets degraded.

If `degraded` is true, treat it as if the video is turned off. If the UI is not changed, the video tile will appear black or frozen.
So for eg. if your UI shows an avatar when the track is not enabled, it should also do so on degradation.
