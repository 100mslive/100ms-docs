title: Remote Mute
nav: 3.13
---

You're running a room and decide that someone who's currently talking shouldn't be talking.

You'd prefer they'd stay mute. Or perhaps you want their video turned off as well as their audio. You're looking for a remote mute.

Muting can apply to both audio and video.

##### Unmuting

You may also decide that you want to let someone else speak who was currently muted. Or may want to ask someone to turn on their video.

You can request people to unmute themselves as well.

### Permissions

Can't let just anyone mute others. First you need to create a [role](../foundation/templates-and-roles) with the permissions to mute others and also to ask them to unmute.

The permission to mute others is `mute` and you should check for that within the the [HMSRole.permissions](../../../api-reference/javascript/v2/interfaces/HMSRole#permissions) of the peer to see if they have it.

Similarly the permission to unmute other peers is `unmute`.

Use the [selectPermissions](../../../api-reference/javascript/v2/home/content#select-permissions) selector to check whether the local peer has the permission to mute or unmute others.

### Muting/Unmuting

Once you have checked that the caller has permissions to mute another peer's audio or video, call for it with `hmsActions.setRemoteTrackEnabled`.

`setRemoteTrackEnabled` takes two parameters

-   `remoteTrackID`: The track ID or array of track IDs of the tracks you want to mute/unmute.
-   `enabled`: `true` if you wish to enable(`unmute` permission is required) the track, `false` if you wish to disable(`mute` permission is required) the track

```js
try {
    await hmsActions.setRemoteTrackEnabled(peer.audioTrack, true);
} catch (error) {
    // Permission denied or invalid track ID or not connected to room
    console.error(error);
}
```

### Handling a mute/unmute request

Once the peer with adequate permissions calls `setRemoteTrackEnabled`, the local peer will receive a [notification](notifications) with type `CHANGE_TRACK_STATE_REQUEST` with a [HMSChangeTrackStateRequest](../../../api-reference/javascript/v2/interfaces/HMSChangeTrackStateRequest) object as the data.

-   Mute requests are automatically applied to the receiver by the SDK. No action is required.

-   For unmute request, hold onto the information from the `HMSChangeTrackStateRequest` object, show a dialog to the user to ask if they want to accept the change and then apply the settings locally. The same as in a regular user [Mute/Unmute](mute).
