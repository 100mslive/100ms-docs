HLS Streaming allows for scaling to millions of viewers in near real time. You can give a link of your
webapp which will be converted to a HLS feed by our server and can be played across devices for consumption.
Behind the scenes, this will be achieved by having a bot join your room and stream what it sees and hears. Once the feed
is ready, the server will give a url which can be played using any HLS Player.

> Note that the media server serving the content in this case is owned by 100ms. If you're looking for a way to stream
on YouTube, Twitch etc., please have a look at our RTMP streaming docs [here](./rtmp-recording).

## Starting HLS

To start HLS, you'll need to pass in a meeting URL. The 100ms bot will open this URL to join your room, so
it must allow access without any user level interaction. In the future, it'll be possible to start HLS for multiple such URLs for the same room.
For this purpose, the API supports taking in an array, although currently only the first element of the array will be respected. To distinguish between
multiple urls, an additional field `metadata` can be optionally passed. The `meetingURL` and `metadata` are clubbed together to form what we'll call
a `variant`.

You can call `hmsActions.startHLSStreaming` with a `hlsConfig` having an array of such variants.

```js
async startHLS() {
    const params = {
        variants: [{meetingURL: "", metadata: "landscape"}]
    };
    try {
        await hmsActions.startHLSStreaming(params);
    } catch (err) {
        console.error("failed to start hls", err);
    }
}
````

## Stopping HLS

You can call `hmsActions.stopHLSStreaming` to stop HLS Streaming which will stop all the variants.

```js
async stopHLS() {
    try {
        await hmsActions.stopHLSStreaming();
    } catch (err) {
        console.error("failed to stop hls", err);
    }
}
```

## Current HLS State

The `selectHLSState` selector can be used to know if HLS is currently running, and the url where it can be viewed.

<Tabs id="hls" items={['JavaScript', 'React']} />{' '}

<Tab id='hls-0'>

```js
function updateHLSState(hlsState) {
    console.log("is hls streaming going on - ", hlsState.running);
    if (hlsState.running) {
        console.log("hls url - ", hlsState.variants[0]?.url)
    }
}

hmsStore.subscribe(updateHLSState, selectHLSState);
```

</Tab>

<Tab  id='hls-1'>

```jsx
function HLSState() {
    const hlsState = useHMSStore(selectHLSState);
    console.log("is hls streaming going on - ", hlsState.running);
    if (hlsState.running) {
        console.log("hls url - ", hlsState.variants[0]?.url)
    }
    return null;
}
```

## Displaying HLS Stream

Not all browsers support HLS [natively](https://caniuse.com/?search=hls), however you can use players like [hls.js](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js/) or
[Shaka Player](https://github.com/google/shaka-player). In case you need more UI side customisations you can go with something like
[videojs](https://videojs.com/) which internally uses `hls.js` for the hls piece.

Here is a simple example of using `hls.js` to play the hls url given by the SDK. Make sure you've installed the library(`npm i hls.js`) before using this code.

<Tabs id="hlsview" items={['JavaScript', 'React']} />{' '}

<Tab id='hlsview-0'>

```js
import Hls from "hls.js";

function renderHLS({hlsUrl}) {
    const video = document.getElementById('video');
    const browserHasNativeHLSSupport = videoRef.current.canPlayType("application/vnd.apple.mpegurl");
    if (Hls.isSupported()) {
        let hls = new Hls();
        hls.loadSource(hlsUrl);
        hls.attachMedia(video);
    }
    // hls.js is not supported on iOS Safari, but as the browser has native support for playing HLS,
    // we can use the video element directly.
    else if (browserHasNativeHLSSupport) {
        video.src = hlsUrl;
    }
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab  id='hlsview-1'>

```jsx
import Hls from "hls.js";

function HLSView({hlsUrl}) {
    const videoRef = useRef(null);
    useEffect(() => {
        if (videoRef.current && hlsUrl) {
            const browserHasNativeHLSSupport = videoRef.current.canPlayType("application/vnd.apple.mpegurl");
            if (Hls.isSupported()) {
                let hls = new Hls();
                hls.loadSource(hlsUrl);
                hls.attachMedia(videoRef.current);
            }
            // hls.js is not supported on iOS Safari, but as the browser has native support for playing HLS,
            // we can use the video element directly.
            else if (browserHasNativeHLSSupport) {
                videoRef.current.src = hlsUrl;
            }
        }
    }, [hlsUrl]);

    return <video ref={videoRef} autoPlay controls></video>
}
```

## Tips

* If you're using the dashboard webapp from 100ms, please make sure to use a role which doesn't have publish permissions for beam tile to not show up.
* If using your own webapp, do put in place retries for API calls like tokens etc. just in case any call fails. As human users we're
used to reloading the page in these scenarios which is difficult to achieve in the automated case.
* Make sure to not disable the logs for the passed in meeting URL. This will allow for us to have more visibility into the room, refreshing the page
if join doesn't happen within a time interval.
