If you want a quick integration of a fully featured video conferencing app inside your application within a day, iframe is the way to go.

You could fork and deploy our [sample web app](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-web/) and use that URL in an iframe or use one of 100ms' links from the [rooms page](https://dashboard.100ms.live/rooms) in your dashboard to make it even quicker.

```html
<iframe
    title="100ms-app"
    allow="camera *;microphone *;display-capture *"
    src="<your-deployed-url-here>"
    style="height: 900px; width: 900px;"
></iframe>
```
