## Overview

[100ms-web](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-web) is a fully-featured sample application built using React. This application gives you a ready-made starting point for writing your own video apps with 100ms or customizing the cloned app per your needs.
You can use this app to test:

-   **Basic functionalities**: Video calling, Recording, Interactive live streaming (HLS), External streaming (RTMP), Screenshare, Picture-in-Picture (PiP).
-   **Interactive features**: Chat (broadcast, direct, & group), Raise hand.
-   **Plugins**: Virtual background, Collaborative whiteboard, Noise suppression.

The app also includes features and capabilities like custom audio/video tracks, control remote peers, network quality and performance stats, adaptive bitrate (Simulcast) and more.

## Set up the app locally

-   Clone the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-web).

    ```bash section=cloneRepo sectionIndex=1
    git clone git@github.com:100mslive/100ms-web.git
    ```

-   Change your working directory to `100ms-web`.

    ```bash section=cloneRepo sectionIndex=2
    cd 100ms-web
    ```

-   Install the dependencies using `npm` or `yarn`.

    ```bash section=cloneRepo sectionIndex=3
    npm install or
    yarn install
    ```

-   Set environment variables to configure token generation endpoint and to [customize your app](#customize-your-app). We have a `example.env` as a template to help you get started with. Create a new file `.env` and copy the values from `example.env`

    ```bash section=envVariable sectionIndex=1
    cp example.env .env
    ```

    -   Get your token endpoint from the [Developer section of 100ms' Dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/developer)

        ![token endpoint](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11087313/140727818-43cd8be4-b3bf-4b34-9921-a77f9a1b819d.png)

    -   Update the `REACT_APP_TOKEN_GENERATION_ENDPOINT` in `.env` file with the above token endpoint value (For example, `https://prod-in.100ms.live/hmsapi/example.app.100ms.live/`)
