## Overview

[100ms-web](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-web) is a fully-featured sample application built using React. This application gives you a ready-made starting point for writing your own video apps or customizing the cloned app as per your needs.

You can use this app to test:

-   **Basic functionalities**: Video calling, Recording, Interactive live streaming (HLS), External streaming (RTMP), Screenshare, Picture-in-Picture (PiP).
-   **Interactive features**: Chat (broadcast, direct, & group), Raise hand.
-   **Plugins**: Virtual background, Collaborative whiteboard, Noise suppression.

The app also includes other features and capabilities like custom audio/video tracks, control remote peers, network quality and performance stats, adaptive bitrate (Simulcast) and more.

If you're trying to get started with 100ms with a basic app, please check our [quickstart guide](./react-quickstart).

## Set up the app locally

-   Clone the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-web).

    ```bash section=cloneRepo sectionIndex=1
    git clone git@github.com:100mslive/100ms-web.git
    ```

-   Change your working directory to `100ms-web`.

    ```bash section=cloneRepo sectionIndex=2
    cd 100ms-web
    ```

-   Install the dependencies using `npm` or `yarn`.

    ```bash section=cloneRepo sectionIndex=3
    npm install or
    yarn install
    ```

-   Set environment variables to configure token generation endpoint. Use the following command to copy the values from "example.env" to a new file called ".env".

    ```bash section=envVariable sectionIndex=1
    cp example.env .env
    ```

-   Update the 100ms token endpoint as an environment variable to handle auth token generation. You can get your token endpoint from the [Developer section of 100ms' Dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/developer).

    ![token endpoint](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11087313/140727818-43cd8be4-b3bf-4b34-9921-a77f9a1b819d.png)

    **Example**:

    ```bash
    REACT_APP_TOKEN_GENERATION_ENDPOINT = 'https://prod-in2.100ms.live/hmsapi/example.app.100ms.live/'
    ```

## Test the app

-   Start the app with the below command. The app now should be running at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). You should see a Welcome message saying "Almost There!".

    ```bash section=runApp sectionIndex=1
    yarn start
    ```

-   To test audio/video functionality, you need to connect to a 100ms room; please check following steps for the same:

    1. Navigate to your [100ms dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/dashboard) or [create an account](https://dashboard.100ms.live/register) if you don't have one.
    2. Use the `Video Conferencing Starter Kit` to create a room with a default template assigned to it to test this app quickly.
    3. Go to [Rooms page](https://dashboard.100ms.live/rooms) in your dashboard, copy the `Room Id` of the room and role created in the above step.
    4. Add the `Room Id` and role to the localhost URL to test the app. For example, `http://localhost:3000/633fcdd84208780bf665346a/host`

    <br />
    <video loop="true" autoplay="autoplay" controls="controls" id="vid" muted>
        <source src="/docs/guides/join-room-sample-app.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
    <br />

## Customize your app

This sample app provides the flexibility to customize the user interface by updating the UI layout, logo, tile aspect ratio, theme and color, etc.

### Configure UI layout

You can customize the layout to arrange the position of video tiles based on roles.

The value of `REACT_APP_POLICY_CONFIG` should be a JSON stringified object of the structure:

```ts section=configureUi sectionIndex=1
type HMSRoleName = string;

/**
 * undefined means none
 * empty array [] for all roles
 */
interface RoleConfig {
    center?: HMSRoleName[];
    sidepane?: HMSRoleName[];
    selfRoleChangeTo?: HMSRoleName[];
    remoteRoleChangeFor?: HMSRoleName[];
}

interface PolicyConfig {
    [role: string]: RoleConfig;
}
```

**Example**:

```bash
REACT_APP_POLICY_CONFIG = "{"trainer":{"center": ["student"],"sidepane":["trainer"]}}"
```

It is used in the app as:

```js section=configureUi sectionIndex=2
const envPolicyConfig = JSON.parse(process.env.REACT_APP_POLICY_CONFIG || '{}');
```

### Change logo

You can upload your logo instead of 100ms logo in the sample app. You can acheive this in two ways:

-   Using the no-code editor in the UI

    <video loop="true" autoplay="autoplay" controls="controls" id="vid" muted>
        <source src="/docs/guides/logo.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
    <br />

-   Adding the image URL in `REACT_APP_LOGO` variable in the .env file.

### Tile Aspect Ratio

`REACT_APP_TILE_SHAPE` can be used for this, the format is `width-height`. For example, `1-1` for square tiles, `4-3` for landscape tiles and `16-9` for wide tiles.

### Theme and Color

**Env - REACT_APP_THEME**

-   `dark` - for dark theme
-   `light` - for light theme

**Env - REACT_APP_COLOR**

-   You can give a hex code the color will be used for buttons, border audio level and such.

### Playlist Tracks (Watch Party)

This is a way to play any music or any videos from a url for everyone in the room to see/vibe to together. The support is only for file formats which are supported by the native audio and video elements, but it's super cool.

`REACT_APP_AUDIO_PLAYLIST` - a list of audio tracks which can be played by a person in the room for everyone
`REACT_APP_VIDEO_PLAYLIST` - a list of video tracks which can be played by a person in the room for everyone
