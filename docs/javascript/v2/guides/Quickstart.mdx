## Prerequisites

In order to get started you must be familiar with rudimentary JavaScript and have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

## Getting started

In this guide, we'll aim to build a video conferencing application using the 100ms JavaScript SDK and the 100ms Reactive Store library.

TL;DR - You can find the link to the complete example over [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/hungry-mannequin-squats-p0i35).

## Installing the dependencies

```bash
npm install --save @100mslive/hms-video @100mslive/hms-video-store
```
