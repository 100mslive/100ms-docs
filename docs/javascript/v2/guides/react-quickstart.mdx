## Getting started

Hello there! In this guide, we'll build a video conferencing application using our React SDK. We'll be using functional
components with the powerful hooks provided by our SDK and build an app where you can have a video call with your friends.

TL;DR - You can find the link to the complete example over [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/100ms-react-quickstart-kh0hy?file=/src/App.jsx).

### Prerequisites

To get started you should be familiar with the basics of [React](https://reactjs.org/).

### Installing the dependencies

```bash
## npm
npm install --save @100mslive/react-sdk@latest
## yarn
yarn add @100mslive/react-sdk@latest
```

### Initializing the SDK

Let us start with initializing the libraries. We need to wrap the entire application with `<HMSRoomProvider />` component.

This will let us use the hooks for state and actions.

```jsx:src/index.js
import { StrictMode } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { HMSRoomProvider } from "@100mslive/hms-video-react";

import App from "./App";

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(
  <StrictMode>
    <HMSRoomProvider>
      <App />
    </HMSRoomProvider>
  </StrictMode>,
  rootElement
);

```

`hmsStore` will hold the complete state of the application such as details of all the participants. We can also visualize this state at any time using the
[devtools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en) extension.

`hmsActions` will help us perform actions such as joining the room, muting our audio/video, and sending messages.

### Concepts

-   `Room`: When we join a conference call, the participants are said to be in a video call `room`.
-   `Peer`: A participant in the video call. You are the `local peer` while others are `remote peers`.
-   `Track`: Media. There are two types of tracks a peer can have - audio and video.

## Joining a room

To join a room (a video call), we need to call the `join` method on `hmsActions` and it requires us to pass a `config` object.
The config object must be passed the following fields:

-   `userName`: The name of the user. This is the value that will be set on the `peer` object and be visible to everyone connected to the room.
-   `authToken`: A client-side token that is used to authenticate the user. You can read about how to generate this token [here](./token).

For our application, let us collect both of these fields from the user using a form. Let's create a `JoinForm` component and add it to the application.

```jsx:src/JoinForm.jsx
import { useState } from "react";
import { useHMSActions } from "@100mslive/hms-video-react";

function JoinForm() {
  const hmsActions = useHMSActions();
  const [inputValues, setInputValues] = useState({
    name: "",
    token: ""
  });

  const handleInputChange = (e) => {
    setInputValues((prevValues) => ({
      ...prevValues,
      [e.target.name]: e.target.value
    }));
  };

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    hmsActions.join({
      userName: inputValues.name,
      authToken: inputValues.token
    });
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <h2>Join Room</h2>
      <div className="input-container">
        <input
          required
          value={inputValues.name}
          onChange={handleInputChange}
          id="name"
          type="text"
          name="name"
          placeholder="Your name"
        />
      </div>
      <div className="input-container">
        <input
          required
          value={inputValues.token}
          onChange={handleInputChange}
          id="token"
          type="text"
          name="token"
          placeholder="Auth token"
        />
      </div>
      <button className="btn-primary">Join</button>
    </form>
  );
}

export default JoinForm;
```

Let's add this form to our `<App>` component.

```jsx:src/App.jsx
export default function App() {
    return (
        <div className="App">
            <JoinForm />
        </div>
    );
}
```

Congratulations! **you now have an audio-only conference ready to use**. If you have a friend join from another device, you can have a nice friendly chat with them.

## Leaving the room

Before we go ahead with adding video, let us add a way to leave the room as well. We can call the `leave` method on `hmsActions` to leave the room.

We'll set up the `leave` method to be called whenever the user closes the window or refreshes the tab.

```jsx{2-8}:src/App.jsx
export default function App() {
  const hmsActions = useHMSActions();

  useEffect(() => {
    window.onunload = () => {
      hmsActions.leave();
    };
  }, [hmsActions]);

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <JoinForm />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Adding video tiles

Let us next add a way to show a tile for every participant in the room. We'll need a list of peers connected to the room.

### Fetching information from state

At any point in time we can get a list of peers with:

```jsx
import { useHMSStore, selectPeers } from '@100mslive/hms-video-react';

function Component() {
    const peers = useHMSStore(selectPeers);
    return <Peers peers={peers} />;
}
```

Let's take a moment to discuss how `hmsStore` works. The store maintains the state of the video call which includes
the list of peers, the connection state of the room, the tracks, track states, etc.
We can use "selectors" that return a slice of the state to get the data piece we're interested in.

The `hmsStore` is also reactive, which means any component using the HMSStore hook will re-render when the slice of the state, it listens to, changes.
This allows us to write [declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) code.

Let us now create a `Conference` component that will render a list of peers. We'll get the peers from the store and render them.
Our component will get rerendered if this list of peers changes.

```jsx:src/Conference.jsx
import { selectPeers, useHMSStore } from "@100mslive/hms-video-react";
import React from "react";
import Peer from "./Peer";

function Conference() {
  const peers = useHMSStore(selectPeers);
  return (
    <div className="conference-section">
      <h2>Conference</h2>

      <div className="peers-container">
        {peers.map((peer) => (
          <Peer key={peer.id} peer={peer} />
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Conference;
```

For each peer, we'll render a `<video>` element and a `<div>` element with their name.

To render the video, we need to call `attachVideo` method of `hmsActions`, which accepts a `trackId` and a DOM element.

But we have abstracted this implementation inside `useVideo` hook for ease. This hook will return a `ref` given a video `trackId`. The returned `ref` can be used to set on a video element meant to display the video. The hook will take care of attaching and detaching video, and will automatically detach when the video goes out of view to save on bandwidth.

```jsx:src/Peer.jsx
import { useVideo } from "@100mslive/react-sdk";

function Peer({ peer }) {
  const ref = useVideo(peer.videoTrack);
  return (
    <div className="peer-container">
      <video
        ref={ref}
        className={`peer-video ${peer.isLocal ? "local" : ""}`}
        autoPlay
        muted
        playsInline
      />
      <div className="peer-name">
        {peer.name} {peer.isLocal ? "(You)" : ""}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Peer;
```

> Note that `height` and `width` CSS properties need to be set on the `<video>` element to render the peer's video.

## Changing UI based on connection state

Right now, our join form shows even after we have joined the room. We need a way to know the connection state of the room and hide the form after we've connected.

We can do this with `selectIsConnectedToRoom` selector.

```jsx{5,8,13,17,22-26}:src/App.jsx
import "./styles.css";
import JoinForm from "./JoinForm";
import Conference from "./Conference";
import { useEffect } from "react";
import {
  selectIsConnectedToRoom,
  useHMSActions,
  useHMSStore
} from "@100mslive/hms-video-react";

export default function App() {
  const isConnected = useHMSStore(selectIsConnectedToRoom);
  const hmsActions = useHMSActions();

  useEffect(() => {
    window.onunload = () => {
      if (isConnected) {
        hmsActions.leave();
      }
    };
  }, [hmsActions, isConnected]);

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Header />
      {isConnected ? (
        <Conference />
      ) : (
        <JoinForm />
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

```

## Muting/unmuting local tracks

Right now we are publishing both audio and video feed of the user whenever they join the room.
We may want to allow the user to mute/unmute their own tracks - both audio and video.

If you specifically need granular data like knowing the current video status you can use `selectIsLocalVideoEnabled` and for audio `selectIsLocalAudioEnabled` instead.

In this case, we can use `useAVToggle` hook which will give us the current audio/video status of the user and also give us functions to toggle them.

```jsx:src/Footer.jsx
import { useAVToggle } from "@100mslive/react-sdk";

function Footer() {
  const {
    isLocalAudioEnabled,
    isLocalVideoEnabled,
    toggleAudio,
    toggleVideo
  } = useAVToggle();
  return (
    <div className="control-bar">
      <button className="btn-control" onClick={toggleAudio}>
        {isLocalAudioEnabled ? "Mute" : "Unmute"}
      </button>
      <button className="btn-control" onClick={toggleVideo}>
        {isLocalVideoEnabled ? "Hide" : "Unhide"}
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Footer;
```

We fetch the current state of the local audio and video and toggle them whenever the buttons are clicked.

![Mute/Unmute](/guides/mute-unmute.gif)

And finally, let's add this component to the `<App>` component to render the buttons only when we are connected to the room.

```jsx{1,19-22}:src/App.js
import Footer from './Footer';

export default function App() {
  const isConnected = useHMSStore(selectIsConnectedToRoom);
  const hmsActions = useHMSActions();

  useEffect(() => {
    window.onunload = () => {
      if (isConnected) {
        hmsActions.leave();
      }
    };
  }, [hmsActions, isConnected]);

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Header />
      {isConnected ? (
        <>
          <Conference />
          <Footer />
        </>
      ) : (
        <JoinForm />
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

That wraps it up for this guide. We hope you had fun.
There is plenty of cool stuff which can be done with our SDK, be sure to check the [features section](/javascript/v2/features/integration) for more information. -->
