While building applications you're gonna hit a lot of errors luckily 100ms SDKs are packed with rich features that help you debug faster.

## Would tell you what's wrong

You're building your app and none of the functionality works and then you check the console.

As you can see i haven't wrapped my root component with `HMSRoomProvider` the error message tells me exactly what my issue it and that's the beauty less time spent on solving such bugs.

Another example where it can extemely helpful even if the actually 'bug' comes from 100ms Dashboard.

You're adding screenshare functionality and when you click on it nothing happens and why is that? and then you see this in the console.

Here my mistake was i joined with the "role" as "guest" which doesn't have screenshare permission (which you set up on 100ms Dashboard) which is not exactly a bug but it still would tell you.

## Fully typed API

Since all our Web SDKs are written in typescript you will get the amazing Intellisense / Autocompletion. When types don't match it would give you the red curly line which will help you avoid future production bugs.

In this example the `sendBroadcastMessage` takes and arg in `string` but i am trying to pass a `number`.

## Hardly need to refer Docs

The coolest thing about 100ms SDKs you will hardly need to visit [100ms Docs](https://docs.100ms.live/) after sometime and the reason for it you will get function params and return types along with an explanation.

Here i get to know everything i need to use `sendBroadcastMessage` function.
