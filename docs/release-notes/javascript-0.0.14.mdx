Thanks for your patience :\). 

This release might still have bugs, some interfaces can change \(we will keep them to a minimum\)

This release has

* Simplified SDK interfaces that can power a fully-featured video conferencing application 
  * `join`
  * `leave`
  * `getPeers, getLocalPeer` for tracks/peers/other data
* Features not covered in this release
  * Handling network disconnections \(disconnect from wi-fi to 4g ends the call\)
  * Handling subscription network degradations
  * Handling second order publish network degradations
  * Detailed analytics
  * Recording
* Our sample app is currently a React edtech app to demonstrate how roles work, and also how our UI-components work. Documentation for these roles will be released soon
* Browser coverage is limited to latest versions of Chrome on desktop. We will improve this over the next few releases
* Please contact @akash goswami in your Slack channel if you have any questions
