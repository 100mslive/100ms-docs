# React v0.1.0

Our alpha release is here ðŸ™ŒðŸ™Œ. If you want to know more about our motivations to move to 2.0, head [here](../)

Thanks for your patience :\).

This release might still have bugs, some interfaces can change \(we will keep them to a minimum\)

This release has

-   Simplified SDK interfaces that can power a fully-featured video conferencing application
    -   `join`
    -   `leave`
    -   `store` for tracks/peers/other data
-   Features not covered in this release
    -   Handling network disconnections \(disconnect from wi-fi to 4g ends the call\)
    -   Handling subscription network degradations
    -   Handling second order publish network degradations
    -   Detailed analytics
    -   Recording
-   Our sample app is currently an edtech app to demonstrate how roles work, and also how our UI-components work. Documentation for these UI-components will be released soon
-   Browser coverage is limited to latest versions of Chrome on desktop. We will improve this over the next few releases
-   Please contact @akash goswami in your Slack channel if you have any questions
