Embed or share room links without building UI

Getting started with 100ms Prebuilt Room Links is the fastest way to test and go live with 100ms. 

[Test Prebuilt Link→](https://examples-videoconferencing.app.100ms.live/meeting/tmz-qdi-cyp)

You can generate Prebuilt Room Links with a standard format : `https://<template-subdomain>/meeting/<room-code>`, where

    1. `template-subdomain` - is the subdomain that you’ve defined at the time of Template creation. 
    2. `room-code` - is a Room Code and belongs to a unique `room_id` and `role` for which you're creating the Room Link. Read more on [Room Codes](/concepts/v2/concepts/rooms/room-codes/room-codes) and its usage.

## Pre-requisites

1. Create your account on [100ms Dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/login)
2. Create a Room Template to define your Room configuration
    - via 100ms dashboard : Go to Templates and set up your first Room Template, here you can configure Roles and their permissions. 
    - via Create Template API : Review the [Template object](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/api-reference/policy/template-object) and create a Template with [Create Template API](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/api-reference/policy/create-template-via-api)
3. Rooms on 100ms : A Room gets created by default associated with the Template you’ve created. Alternatively, go ahead and create a Room programatically.
    1. Rooms are created on 100ms server and requires your unique [Management Token](https://www.100ms.live/docs/concepts/v2/concepts/security-and-tokens#management-token-for-rest-api) to authenticate all Create Room requests.
    2. Review [Rooms object](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/api-reference/Rooms/object) and create a Room with [Create a Room API](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/api-reference/Rooms/create-via-api)
4. Once you have your first Room ready, you can now go ahead and create and create Prebuilt Room Links.

## Create Prebuilt Room Links

### 1. On 100ms Dashboard [No Code]

1. Go to Rooms page on [100ms dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/dashboard) and select a Room to go to Rooms details page.
2. On clicking “Join Room”, you can either copy or Join the Prebuilt Link.

### 2. Construct Prebuilt Link

1. You need a Template-subdomain and Room Code to construct Prebuilt Room Links with format : `https://<template-subdomain>/meeting/<room-code>`

    - Template Subdomain - You can get the template subdomain under Templates > Your Template on [100ms Dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/dashboard)
    - Room Code - Get Room Code from [Create Room Code API](/server-side/v2/api-reference/Rooms/create-via-api) 
        
2. Create Room Link structure : Append template-subdomain and Room code to the room link format.
   
   Here is an example pseudo code snippet involving creating a room and then creating room links for that room.
    
    ```python
    # template info
    template_id = "639cb27a0c77c9782cc50e7b"
    template_subdomain = "piyush.app.100ms.live"
    
    # create room 
    room_response = create_room(template_id)
    
    # create room code for the above created room
    room_codes = create_room_codes(room_response["id"])
    
    # create create room links by appending room_code to template_subdomain
    # room_link = https://<template-subdomain>/meeting/<room-code>
    room_links = {}
    for data in room_codes:
    	room_links[data["role"]] = "https://"+template_subdomain+"/meeting/"+data["code"]
    
    print(room_links)
    ```

## Embed or Share Room Links

Embed Prebuilt links as iFrame on web, mobile-web

If you want a quick integration of a fully featured video conferencing/live streaming app inside your application within a day, iframe is the way to go.

**iframe integration benefits:**

- You can have a fully-featured video conferencing/live streaming UI added to your web app with minimal development
- You can customize to a greatest extent as per your requirements
- You can use this in the framework you're already using in your app
- Using an iframe you can embed the whole sample web app inside your UI wherever you want

**Implementation**

Embed the Prebuilt Room Link as an iframe in your application

```jsx
<iframe
    title="100ms-app"
    allow="camera *;microphone *;display-capture *"
    src="https://<your-template-subdomain>/meeting/dsj-sdkw-oer"
    style="height: 900px; width: 900px;">
</iframe>
```

### Send shareable links to your users

You can share Room links with you users on the fly as Push notification, SMS, Email etc.
