When a user joins a session on 100ms, a corresponding peer is created for them on 100ms. Peer insights comprise a complete collection of events, an overall connection quality score, and network performance for a peer's entire session duration, providing comprehensive data to evaluate their overall experience. Key components include:

## Measuring peer level insights

To debug the call experience of a peer and gain insights into their session, follow these steps:

1. Go to the "Sessions" section in the [100ms dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/dashboard)
2. Select or enter a Session ID
3. Select a peer or enter a peer ID to debug.
4. Explore the insights for the selected peer, including peer details, events performed, and network performance metrics that impacted the media quality during the session.

## Peer details

Peer details, such as who the peer was, the session they belonged to, and a summary of their device setup, help you identify and contextualize the peer's experience.

### Peer Information

- **Name** -The name of the peer.
- **Peer ID** -A unique 100ms-generated peer ID.
