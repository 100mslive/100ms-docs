Event Log for a peer is a visual representation of all peer events that occur from the moment a peer joins a video session until they leave. This graph is useful in understanding what events happened for a peer in a sequential form or in parallel, hence useful in drawing co-relations to what went in a call. All peer related events can be abstracted in the following event types:

1. **Audio** - event occurs when the peer turns on/off their mic  
2. **Video** - event occurs when the peer turns on/off their camera  
3. **Screen** - event when peer starts and stops sharing their screen
4. **Device** - occurs when an input and output  audio/video device is selected at preview/join screen or switched during a session. It also shows the device type selected. This is available only on web platform.
5. **Error** - error events that happened for a peer during a session
