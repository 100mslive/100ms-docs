## Media Quality Types

Quality measurement in video conferencing systems involves assessing both the outgoing/publisher media quality that is being sent from a peer as well as the incoming/subscriber media quality being received by the peer. Media quality can be observed in two dimensions:

1. **Outgoing or Publisher Media Quality**: This dimension represents the quality of outgoing audio and video streams sent from a peer's device. It is influenced by factors such as the device's processing power, encoder efficiency, and the available uplink bandwidth.
2. I**ncoming or Subscriber Media Quality**: This dimension refers to the quality of incoming audio and video streams received by a peer from other peers in the call. It is primarily impacted by the network conditions on the ~~remote~~ publishing end, including factors like available downlink bandwidth, packet loss, jitter, and the efficiency of the decoder on the receiving device.

## Network metrics impact media quality

There are several factors on which quality can be measured such as bitrate, jitter, round trip time, packet loss, CPU limitation, network limitation impact incoming and outgoing media quality of a video session.

### Bitrate

Defines the amount of data transferred measured in bits per second (bps). The maximum achievable bitrate depends on factors like RTT, packet loss, and available network bandwidth. Additionally, this also depends on the bitrate values configured for the respective role under templates.

<Callout title="Bitrate and audio/video quality">
- Higher bitrates allow for higher-quality video and audio streaming, but they also consume more bandwidth.
- Standard Bitrates
    - Audio: 32kbps for audio 
    - Video: Depends on [Video Quality](/get-started/v2/get-started/concepts/templates-and-roles#publish-strategies) configured under publish strategies for the role.
- [Connection quality score](/get-started/v2/get-started/insights/connection-quality-score) uses the ratio of Actual Bitrate received/Expected Bitrate to determine its video and audio quality.

</Callout>
    

### Frame Rate (FPS)

Frame Rate or Frames per second is the complete still image frames that are displayed or transmitted per second in video conferencing.

<Callout title ="Frame rates and video quality">
- Common frame rates used in video conferencing are 15 FPS, 30 FPS and 60 FPS. 
- Higher FPS requires transmitting more frames in the same period with a smoother motion, thus it demands **higher video bitrates** and **network bandwidth capabilities.**
- Lower frame rates can suffer from choppy transitions between frames.
</Callout>

### Packet Loss

Defines the percentage of lost/dropped packets. It occur due to network congestion, insufficient bandwidth, faulty network hardware, etc. This can degrade the quality of audio and video in a WebRTC session.

<Callout title="Packet loss and quality">

- Lower packet loss leads to higher audio/video quality
- Packet Loss >5% is considered as degraded audio/video
</Callout>

### **Round Trip Time (RTT)**

Measures the time in milliseconds (ms) it takes for a packet of data to travel from the source to the destination and back again. 

<Callout title="A lower RTT represents better connection quality">
- Lower RTT represents better connection quality
- Higher RTT:
	- Increased latency, leading to delays between sender and receiver, making communication less natural
	- Can cause video freezing or stuttering due to untimely frame arrival, disrupting smooth playback
	- Can cause audio and video desynchronization, resulting in lip-sync issues
	- Real-time feedback and interactivity can feel delayed or unresponsive, leading to a frustrating experience
Small RTT increases may not have a significant impact, but exceeding thresholds (200-300ms) can pronounce impact on video quality
</Callout>



### Jitter

Jitter is the variation in the delay of received data packets. 

<Callout title="A lower RTT represents better connection quality">
	- Lower jitter is desirable for better connection quality.
	- High jitter can cause issues with real-time applications, leading to choppy video or audio quality.
</Callout>



### CPU and Network Limitations
Insufficient CPU or network resources can bottleneck the performance of a connection. CPU limitations can cause delays in processing incoming and outgoing data, while network limitations can lead to congestion and increased latency.

#### CPU Limitations

- High CPU usage (more than 80%) can cause delays in processing incoming and outgoing data, leading to increased latency, jitter, and packet loss.
- Low CPU usage (less than 30%) can indicate underutilization of resources, which may not be an issue unless other resources are also constrained.

#### Network Limitations

- High network utilization (less than 80%) can cause congestion, leading to increased latency, jitter, and packet loss.
- Low network utilization (more than 30%) may not be an issue unless other resources are also constrained.
