## Media Quality Types

Quality measurement in video conferencing systems involves assessing both the outgoing/publisher media quality that is being sent from a peer as well as the incoming/subscriber media quality being received by the peer. Media quality can be observed in two dimensions:

1. **Outgoing or Publisher Media Quality**: This dimension represents the quality of outgoing audio and video streams sent from a peer's device. It is influenced by factors such as the device's processing power, encoder efficiency, and the available uplink bandwidth.
2. I**ncoming or Subscriber Media Quality**: This dimension refers to the quality of incoming audio and video streams received by a peer from other peers in the call. It is primarily impacted by the network conditions on the ~~remote~~ publishing end, including factors like available downlink bandwidth, packet loss, jitter, and the efficiency of the decoder on the receiving device.

## Network metrics impact media quality

There are several factors on which quality can be measured such as bitrate, jitter, round trip time, packet loss, CPU limitation, network limitation impact incoming and outgoing media quality of a video session.

### Bitrate

Defines the amount of data transferred measured in bits per second (bps). The maximum achievable bitrate depends on factors like RTT, packet loss, and available network bandwidth.

<Callout title="Bitrate and audio/video quality">
- Higher bitrates allow for higher-quality video and audio streaming, but they also consume more bandwidth.
- Standard Bitrates
    - Audio:
    - Video:
- [Connection quality score](/get-started/v2/get-started/insights/connection-quality-score) uses the ratio of Actual Bitrate received/Expected Bitrate to determine its video and audio quality.

### Frame Rate (FPS)

Frame Rate or Frames per second is the complete still image frames that are displayed or transmitted per second in video conferencing.

Common frame rates used in video conferencing are 15 FPS, 30 FPS and 60 FPS. 

- Higher frame rates result in video with smoother motion
- Lower frame rates can suffer from choppy transitions between frames.

<Callout title ="Frame rates and video quality">

- Higher FPS requires transmitting more frames in the same period so it demands **higher video bitrates** and **network bandwidth capabilities.**
</Callout>

### Packet Loss

Defines the percentage of lost/dropped packets. It occur due to network congestion, insufficient bandwidth, faulty network hardware, etc. This can degrade the quality of audio and video in a WebRTC session.

<Callout title="Packet loss and quality">

- Lower packet loss leads to higher audio/video quality
- Packet Loss >5% is considered as degraded audio/video
</Callout>


In both cases, higher packet loss rates result in more noticeable quality degradation. Packet loss can be caused by network congestion, insufficient bandwidth, or connectivity issues.

### **Round Trip Time (RTT)**

Measures the time in milliseconds (ms) it takes for a packet of data to travel from the source to the destination and back again. 

<Callout title="A lower RTT represents better connection quality">
    - whereas higher RTT
        - introduces increased latency, leading to a delay between the sender's actions and the receiver's perception, making real-time communication less natural.
        - can cause video freezing or stuttering, as video frames don't arrive at the receiver in a timely manner, disrupting smooth playback.
        - can cause audio and video desynchronization, resulting in a mismatch between audio and video signals, creating a "lip-sync" issue.
    - Real-time feedback and interactivity between participants can feel delayed or unresponsive due to high RTT, leading to a frustrating user experience.
    - Small increases in RTT may not have a significant impact, but once RTT exceeds certain thresholds (often 200-300ms), the impact on video quality can become more pronounced.
</Callout>



### Jitter

Jitter is the variation in the delay of received data packets. High jitter can cause issues with real-time applications, leading to choppy video or audio quality. Lower jitter is desirable for better connection quality.


### CPU and Network Limitations

Insufficient CPU or network resources can bottleneck the performance of a connection. CPU limitations can cause delays in processing incoming and outgoing data, while network limitations can lead to congestion and increased latency.
