100ms provides infrastructure and client-side SDKs for you to build real-time, audio-video interactive experiences in your app. 100ms combines the capabilities of video conferencing (built over WebRTC), live streaming (built over [HLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming)) and real-time databases. These capabilities can be used to build engaging live experiences—like virtual classrooms, live streams, tele-health consultations and multiplayer social gaming—in your web or mobile apps.

## Understanding 100ms

### Rooms and roles

Everything in 100ms happens inside **rooms**. Your users can join a room, publish audio/video and interact with each other while they are in the room, and then leave the room.

The room contains references to **peers** (users in the room) and **tracks** (audio, video, screen share) in the room. When the first peer joins a room, a new **session** is created. When the last peer leaves, the session ends. A room can have multiple sessions.

Peers inside a room belong to a **role**, which defines what a peer can do in the room. For example, can they publish video, can they mute other peers, and so on. A peer can change roles while they are in the room.

### Interactivity in the room

The room can be used to enable different levels of interactivity.

#### Level 1: Full duplex audio/video in real-time

Level 1 participants publish their audio/video, and interact with others in sub-second latency. This is real-time video conferencing, similar to Zoom or Google Meet.

#### Level 2: Webinar-style audience in real-time

    Level 2 participants consume audio/video from level 1 participants with sub-second latency, without publishing their own audio/video. Level 2 participants can engage with level 1 through messaging (chat, emojis, custom events). This is similar to a Zoom webinar.

    Levels 1 and 2 are enabled using WebRTC.

#### Level 3: Live stream audience consuming in near real-time

    Level 3 participants consume a composite live stream in near real-time (\<10 secs of latency) without publishing their audio/video. They can interact with other participants via messaging. This is similar to viewers on Twitch or YouTube Live.

## Integration paths

100ms can be used to make embedded, custom live video integrations that blend with the rest of your application. For some use-cases, it is faster to start with a "pre-built" web app. Pick an option that suits your use-case.
