A Room Link is a link that a peer can use to join a room. It is always associated to a specific room and role, allowing unique room links for each role in a room.

<Callout icon="link" title="Room Links Basics">

In order to construct unique room links for each role in your room, you need
	- a domain to host the sample web app
		- use 100ms hosted `template-subdomain` when using Prebuilt room links
		- self-hosted `your-domain` when customising and deploying our sample web apps. 
	- a role specific [room code](/get-started/v2/get-started/prebuilt/room-codes/overview). For instance,
		- host : `abc-perj-xno`
		- guest : `jnj-owef-kjs`

## Prebuilt Room Links

If you're using 100ms Prebuilt solution, the room link looks like : `https://<template-subdomain>/meeting/<room-code>`

1. `template-subdomain` : This the subdomain that youâ€™ve defined at the time of template creation on 100ms dashboard. 
2. `room-code` : This belongs to a unique `room_id` and `role` for which you're creating the room link

Head over to [Construct a Prebuilt Room Link](/concepts/v2/concepts/Prebuilt#create-prebuilt-room-links) for details.


## Custom Domain Room Links

If you're using 100ms sample apps or building from scratch, you'd need to construct a custom Room Link to embed or share it with your users. A custom domain Room Link looks like `https://<your-domain>/<room-code>`

1. `your-domain` : This allows you to define a customised Room Link  
2. `room-code` : This belongs to a unique `room_id` and `role` for which you're creating the Room Link


### Sample Workflow for custom room links
1. Create a Template, Room and at least one Role
2. Use [Create Room Code](/server-side/v2/api-reference/room-codes/create-room-code-api) to generate room codes for one or more roles in a room
3. [Retrieve Room Codes](/server-side/v2/api-reference/room-codes/get-room-code-api) for each role in the room.
3. Construct your custom domain room link by appending the retrieved [room code](/get-started/v2/get-started/prebuilt/room-codes/overview) to the URL format for each role in the room.



Make sure to use only enabled room codes to create room links. Read about [Room Code Basics](/concepts/v2/concepts/rooms/room-codes/room-codes#room-codes-basics)
