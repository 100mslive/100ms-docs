100ms Prebuilt is a feature-rich video conferencing/live streaming [web app](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-web/) made using our prebuilt components. Prebuilt allows users to join sharable room links via desktop, meeting invites, or as an embeddable experience using an [iFrame](/docs/get-started/v2/get-started/prebuilt/prebuilt#share-or-embed-as-iframe), or as a native component in your apps.

### Using Pre-built

-   Operate at high speeds and set up Prebuilt in your application within minutes, allowing you to focus your time on building your core product.
-   With low-level audio and video nuances already taken care of, using 100ms Prebuilt allows for faster Go-To-Market, without requiring upfront investment or ongoing maintenance.

## Share and Embed Prebuilt

Depending on the desired user experience, you can use Prebuilt in versatile ways with just few lines of code.

## Get started with Prebuilt links

In this guide, we will create role specific prebuilt room links and share/embed the link as an iFrame in your application.

<StepsContainer id="implement-breakout-room">

### Get room code and template subdomain

<FlexContainer>
<Callout icon="link" title="Prebuilt Link Structure">
Prebuilt links are role specific room links with a format `https://<template-subdomain>.app.100ms.live/<room-code>` where,
    - `template-subdomain`- is the subdomain that you’ve defined at the time of template creation on [100ms Dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/dashboard). Copy `template-subdomain` from Template details page on 100ms Dashboard
    - `room-code`- is a [room code](/concepts/v2/concepts/rooms/room-codes/room-codes) that belongs to a unique`room_id` and `role` for which you're creating the room link. Get room codes for each role 
            - Copy role specific room code from Join Room section for a role in a room
            - [Create Room Codes API](/server-side/v2/api-reference/room-codes/create-room-code-api) to create room codes
</Callout>
</FlexContainer>

### Construct the link

Once you have the template-subdomain and room code ready, append these to the link structure for all roles in your room.

<FlexContainer>
    <Callout icon="link" title="Prebuilt Link for roles">
        - Host Prebuilt Link : https://`template-subdomain`/meeting/`room-code-for-host` - Guest
        Prebuilt Link : https://`template-subdomain`/meeting/`room-code-for-guest`
    </Callout>
</FlexContainer>

### Share or Embed as iFrame

Once you have a Prebuilt room link ready, you can share it with your users on the fly as Push notification, SMS, Email etc or directly embed the link in your application. Refer a sample code snippet to embed the prebuilt link as an iFrame.

```html
<iframe
    title="100ms-app"
    allow="camera *;microphone *;display-capture *"
    src="https://<your-template-subdomain>/meeting/<room-code>"
    style="height: 100vh; width: 100%; border:0;"
>
</iframe>
```

</StepsContainer>

## Embed as Component

100ms Prebuilt can be embedded as a native component `HMSPrebuilt` by importing HMSRoomKit in your apps.

<FlexContainer>
<Callout icon="link" title="HMSPrebuilt Component Basics">

    - **HMSPrebuilt -** high-order component from HMSRoom Kit that handles all audio/video functionality within a room
        - has default colors and styles of 100ms, which can be overridden from the dashboard.
        - HMSPrebuilt requires room-code for peers to join the room

    - **HMSRoomKit** -  Collection of embeddable 100ms UI components for your apps.
        - `HMSPrebuilt` is the first embeddable UI component of HMSRoomKit.

### Create and Get room code

HMSPrebuilt uses [room code](/concepts/v2/concepts/rooms/room-codes/room-codes) to get initialised, it allow users to uniquely join a `room_id` with a specifc `role`. Head over to

-   [Create Room Codes](/docs/get-started/v2/get-started/prebuilt/room-codes/overview#creating-room-codes)
-   [Get Room Code](/docs/server-side/v2/api-reference/room-codes/create-room-code-api)

### Embedding HMSPrebuilt component

    - Import - HMSPrebuilt component requires importing HMSRoomKit
    - Initialise - Along with room code, you can additionally add options such as `userName` and `userID` in the component
        - `userName` - prefills the user name on HMSPrebuilt preview screen
        - `userID` - use your user IDs to track joins, if not passed 100ms auto-generates a userID
    - Customise - You can override themes and colors to match it with your app themes
