100ms Prebuilt is a feature rich video conferencing / live streaming app built on top on our [sample web app](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-web/). Share Prebuilt room links with users or [embed it as an iFrame](/get-started/v2/get-started/prebuilt/prebuiltNew#embedding-as-iframe) in your application.

Getting started with 100ms Prebuilt Room Links is the fastest way to test and go live with 100ms. [Test Prebuilt Link→](https://examples-videoconferencing.app.100ms.live/meeting/tmz-qdi-cyp)

## Get started with Prebuilt links

In this guide, we will create role specific prebuilt room links and share/embed the link as an iFrame in your application.

<FlexContainer>
<Callout icon="link" title="Prebuilt Link Structure">
Prebuilt links are role specific room links with a format `https://<template-subdomain>.app.100ms.live/<room-code>` where,
    - `template-subdomain`- is the subdomain that you’ve defined at the time of template creation on [100ms Dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/dashboard). Copy `template-subdomain` from Template details page on 100ms Dashboard
    - `room-code`- is a [room code](/concepts/v2/concepts/rooms/room-codes/room-codes) that belongs to a unique`room_id` and `role` for which you're creating the room link. Get room codes for each role 
            - Copy role specific room code from Join Room section for a role in a room
            - [Create Room Codes API](/server-side/v2/api-reference/room-codes/create-room-code-api) to create room codes
</Callout>
</FlexContainer>


### Construct the link

Once you have the template-subdomain and room code ready, append these to the link structure for all roles in your room.

- Host Prebuilt Link : https://`template-subdomain`/meeting/`room-code-for-host`
- Guest Prebuilt Link : https://`template-subdomain`/meeting/`room-code-for-guest`


### Share or Embed as iFrame

Once you have a Prebuilt room link ready, you can share it with your users on the fly as Push notification, SMS, Email etc or directly embed the link in your application. Refer a sample code snippet


```jsx
<iframe
    title="100ms-app"
    allow="camera *;microphone *;display-capture *"
    src="https://<your-template-subdomain>/meeting/<room-code>"
    style="height: 900px; width: 900px;">
</iframe>
```
