### Adding custom backgrounds

By default, 100ms offers a set of backgrounds when you enable virtual backgrounds on 100ms Prebuilt. However, you can also personalize the experience by adding custom background images for specific roles. These will seamlessly list with default backgrounds on the Prebuilt UI. To add custom backgrounds:

1. Upload an image (file size should be less than 2MB).
2. Provide a publicly hosted URL for the background image.


### Customizing background image sequence

Once custom backgrounds are added, you can take control of their display order alongside default backgrounds. Select the images in the desired sequence, and these selections will be reflected in the Prebuilt UI, ensuring the role see the desired sequence of your chosen backgrounds. You can choose to disable default backgrounds by unchecking them from the background picker.
