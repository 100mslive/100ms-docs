<FlexContainer>
<Callout icon="link" title="Prebuilt Link Structure">
Prebuilt links are role specific room links with a format `https://<template-subdomain>/<room-code>` where,
    - `template-subdomain`- is the subdomain that you’ve defined at the time of template creation on [100ms Dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/dashboard). Copy `subdomain` from Template details page on 100ms Dashboard
    - `room-code`- is a [room code](/concepts/v2/concepts/rooms/room-codes/room-codes) that belongs to a unique`room_id` and `role` for which you're creating the room link. Get room codes for each role 
            - Copy role specific room code from Join Room section for a role in a room
            - [Create Room Codes API](/server-side/v2/api-reference/room-codes/create-room-code-api) to create room codes
</Callout>

  </Callout>
</FlexContainer>

### Share or Embed as iFrame

Once you have a Prebuilt link ready, you can share it with your users on the fly as push notification, SMS, email etc or directly embed the link in your application.
Refer the sample code snippet to embed the Prebuilt link as an iframe.

```html
<iframe
  title="100ms-app"
  allow="camera *;microphone *;display-capture *"
  src="https://<your-template-subdomain>/meeting/<room-code>"
  style="height: 100vh; width: 100%; border:0;"
>


</iframe>
```

## Embed as Component

100ms Prebuilt can be embedded as a native component `HMSPrebuilt` by importing `RoomKit` package in your app.

<FlexContainer>
<Callout icon="link" title="HMSPrebuilt Component Basics">
    - **RoomKit**
        -  collection of embeddable 100ms UI components for your app.

        - `userName` - prefills the user name on HMSPrebuilt preview screen
        - `userID` - use your user IDs to track user of your app
