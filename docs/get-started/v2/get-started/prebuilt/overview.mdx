100ms Prebuilt is a feature-rich live video app that can be embedded in your web or mobile apps.

Prebuilt is a high-level abstraction that enables you to embed video conferencing and/or live streaming UI—with a few lines of code. Prebuilt abstracts out nuances regarding audio/video integration which enables your end-users to get reliable live video without the hassles of integration.

100ms Prebuilt is available as **links** that can be shared with end-users or **components** that can be embedded inside existing apps.

### Get room code and template subdomain

<FlexContainer>
<Callout icon="link" title="Prebuilt Link Structure">
Prebuilt links are role specific room links with a format `https://<template-subdomain>/<room-code>` where,
    - `template-subdomain`- is the subdomain that you’ve defined at the time of template creation on [100ms Dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/dashboard). Copy `subdomain` from Template details page on 100ms Dashboard
    - `room-code`- is a [room code](/concepts/v2/concepts/rooms/room-codes/room-codes) that belongs to a unique`room_id` and `role` for which you're creating the room link. Get room codes for each role 
            - Copy role specific room code from Join Room section for a role in a room
            - [Create Room Codes API](/server-side/v2/api-reference/room-codes/create-room-code-api) to create room codes
</Callout>
</FlexContainer>

### Construct the link

Once you have the template-subdomain and room code ready, append these to the link structure for all roles in your room.

<FlexContainer>
  <Callout icon="link" title="Prebuilt Link for roles">
    - Host Prebuilt Link :
    https://`template-subdomain`/meeting/`room-code-for-host`<br/>
    - Guest Prebuilt Link : https://`template-subdomain`/meeting/`room-code-for-guest`
  </Callout>
</FlexContainer>

### Share or Embed as iFrame

Once you have a Prebuilt link ready, you can share it with your users on the fly as push notification, SMS, email etc or directly embed the link in your application.
Refer the sample code snippet to embed the Prebuilt link as an iframe.

```html
<iframe
  title="100ms-app"
  allow="camera *;microphone *;display-capture *"
  src="https://<your-template-subdomain>/meeting/<room-code>"
  style="height: 100vh; width: 100%; border:0;"
>
</iframe>
```

</StepsContainer>

## Embed as Component

100ms Prebuilt can be embedded as a native component `HMSPrebuilt` by importing 100ms Room Kit package in your app.

<FlexContainer>
<Callout icon="link" title="Component Basics">

Head over to guides for [create room codes](/server-side/v2/api-reference/room-codes/create-room-code-api) and [get room code](/server-side/v2/api-reference/room-codes/get-room-code-api).

### Embedding HMSPrebuilt component

- Initialise - Along with room code, you can additionally set `userName` and `userID` of the user joining the room
    - `userName` - prefills the user name on HMSPrebuilt preview screen
    - `userID` - use your user IDs to track user of your app
