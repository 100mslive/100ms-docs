## Switching Between Dark and Light Themes

Prebuilt offers two distinct themes for your app: a dark theme and a light theme. You can choose the one that best suits your appâ€™s aesthetics or user preferences.

Once you toggle the theme switch to select either the dark or light theme, your Prebuilt app will be displayed with the selected theme.

<Note>
If you change the theme type, your color customizations will be reset. Be sure to reconfigure your color settings in the "Color Tokens" section after switching between the dark and light themes to maintain your desired appearance.
