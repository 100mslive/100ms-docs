The 100ms dashboard provides secure access to manage your account, configurations, and resources. You can sign up or log in to the dashboard using one of the following methods:

1. **Google Oauth**: Sign up or log in using your Google account credentials. 
2. **GitHub**: Sign up or log in using your GitHub account.
3. **Email and Password**: Sign up or log in by providing your email address and creating a password.

## Customizing Access Methods

If you prefer to restrict access methods for your organization, you can disable specific sign-up and login options. To disable an access method, please reach out to our support team at [support@100ms.live](mailto:support@100ms.live).

For enterprises with strict access control policies, you may need to disable GitHub and email/password login options for your account. This ensures that your employees can only log in to the 100ms dashboard using their Google Workspace account through Oauth

By disabling alternative login methods and enforcing Oauth through Google Workspace, you can ensure that access to the 100ms platform is restricted to authorized personnel within your organization, aligning with your enterprise security policies.

## Session Expiry

For enhanced security, dashboard sessions will automatically expire after 24 hours of inactivity or when you explicitly log out of the dashboard. This measure ensures that your account remains secure and prevents unauthorized access.
