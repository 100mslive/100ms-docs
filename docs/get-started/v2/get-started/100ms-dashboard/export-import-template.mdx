1. Click on the **Templates** dropdown in the sidebar, and pick a template you want to export

1. From the dropdown, click on **Export Template** and you're done

You should now see `<template-name>.json` in your downloads.

<Note type='warning' title="Warning: Do not modify the exported template">
The \<template-name\>.json file contains the configuration for your template. Modifying it could break your template and cause it to not work properly. We recommend against modifying this file unless you are familiar with the JSON format and the structure of template configuration files. If you need to modify the configuration of your template, please consult our documentation for more information.
