title: Auth Token vs Room Code
nav: 5.3
---

When setting up video sessions, developers can choose between two options for access control: room codes or authentication tokens. Both can enable joining a session, but serve different use cases. Here's a comparison, along with recommendations for common use cases.


- **Room codes are recommended** for creating shareable join links for sessions. They can also power authentication for peers joining a session, eliminating the need to generate an authentication token.
- **Authentication tokens** are ideal for peer authentication during join flows, particularly when your use case doesn't require join links.


## Comparing the set up
Before integrating, it's important to define your implementation stack. Let's examine the key differences between the two.


|  | Room Codes | Authentication Token |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Parity | Encrypted code representing a unique `role` and `room_id` combination. Additional user context can be passed to make these codes user specific. | JWT token. Auth token is unique to a `role`, `user_id` and `room_id`. |
| Set-up | Use server-side [Room Codes APIs](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/api-reference/room-codes/create-room-code-api). Management Token is required | [Server-side set up](https://www.100ms.live/docs/get-started/v2/get-started/security-and-tokens#set-up-your-token-server) to generate auth token. Management token is not required |
| Expiry | [Room Codes do not expire](https://www.100ms.live/docs/prebuilt/v2/prebuilt/room-codes/overview#room-codes-do-not-expire). Peers can access rooms using links created with room codes, unless disabled.  | Set a desired expiry for auth token. Peers cannot join a session if their auth token expires. |

## Key Recommendations

Letâ€™s take a closer look on deciding which method to use based on your integration path.

### When using 100ms Prebuilt UI:

1. When your use case requires joining via Prebuilt links:
    1. Use room codes - Create shareable [Prebuilt links](https://www.100ms.live/docs/prebuilt/v2/prebuilt/quickstart#prebuilt-links); handles auth token creation implicitly. Supports additional user context like username and user ID
    2. Authentication is implicitly handled by the Prebuilt UI
2. When you're embedding the native [Prebuilt component](https://www.100ms.live/docs/prebuilt/v2/prebuilt/quickstart#embed-as-component):
    1. You can directly use room codes to join or authentication tokens
    

### When building Custom UI:

1. When your use case requires joining via your [custom links](https://www.100ms.live/docs/prebuilt/v2/prebuilt/room-codes/room-links#custom-domain-room-links):
    1. Use room codes to create custom links; can pass additional user context like username and user ID
2. When building an embedded custom UI for joining without links, authenticate users using:
    1. [Room code authentication](https://www.100ms.live/docs/prebuilt/v2/prebuilt/room-codes/room-code-auth#join-rooms-with-room-codes-for-custom-ui) - Use SDK method `getAuthTokenByRoomCode` to fetch auth token to join sessions. Alternatively, you can set up auth token setup on your end.
    2. [Authentication tokens](https://www.100ms.live/docs/get-started/v2/get-started/security-and-tokens#auth-token-for-client-sdks) - Set up an auth token server on your end
