title: Auth Token vs Room Code
nav: 5.3
---

When setting up video sessions, developers can choose between two options for granting access and authenticating peers: room codes or authentication tokens. But when is each appropriate? Here's a comparison, along with recommendations for common use cases.


- **Room codes are recommended** for creating shareable join links for sessions. They can also power authentication for peers joining a session, eliminating the need to generate an authentication token.
- **Authentication tokens** are ideal for peer authentication during join flows, particularly when your use case doesn't require join links.


## Comparing the set up
Before integrating, it's important to define your implementation stack. Let's examine the key differences between the two.


|  | Room Codes | Authentication Token |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Parity | Unique codes against a `role` and `room_id` combination. Additional user context can be passed to make these codes user specific. | JWT token. Auth token is unique to a `role`, `user_id` and `room_id`. |
| Set-up | Use server-side [Room Codes APIs](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/api-reference/room-codes/create-room-code-api). Management Token is required | [Server-side set up](https://www.100ms.live/docs/get-started/v2/get-started/security-and-tokens#set-up-your-token-server) to generate auth token. Management token is not required |
| Expiry | [Room Codes do not expire](https://www.100ms.live/docs/prebuilt/v2/prebuilt/room-codes/overview#room-codes-do-not-expire). Peers can access rooms using links created with room codes, unless disabled.  | Set a desired expiry for auth token. Default expiry duration is 24 hours. Peers cannot join a session if their auth token is expires. |

## Key Recommendations

Let’s take a closer look on deciding which method to use when you’ve opted to build your user using 100ms Prebuilt and custom UI

| Implementation |	Room Codes | Auth Tokens |
| ------- | ---------- | ------------|
| Prebuilt Links | Use room codes to create shareable Prebuilt links; can pass additional user context like user name and user ID| Not required; as 100ms Prebuilt handles room codes implicitly handles authentication |
| Prebuilt Component |	Authenticate peers and join using room codes |	Authenticate peers and join using auth token |
| Custom Links | Use room codes to create shareable custom links; can pass additional user context like user name and user ID |	Use SDK method `getAuthTokenByRoomCode` to fetch auth token to join sessions. Alternatively, you can set up auth token setup at your end |
| Custom UI | Authenticate peers and join using room codes | Can use authentication token to authenticate peers |

In simpler terms,
1. Room codes simplify link creation
2. Both room codes & auth tokens work for authenticating peers and joining a session
