### Getting Started

100ms has developed a collaborative whiteboard using [tldraw 2.0](https://tldraw.dev/), powered entirely by its own signaling backend.

### Enabling and Configuring the Whiteboard

Whiteboard can be configured from the 100ms dashboard.

#### Enabling the Whiteboard

1. Navigate to a specific Template where you wish to enable the Whiteboard.
2. Click on **‘Advanced Settings’** tab in the Template configuration.
3. Enable ‘**Whiteboard**’.

#### Recording and live streaming the Whiteboard

To record or live stream whiteboard activities, this permission must be enabled. If disabled, the whiteboard will not appear in room composite recordings or live streams. Ensure recording or live streaming is activated in the template settings to enable this feature.

#### Configuring the permissions

There are three permission levels for managing the whiteboard:

1. **Launch, Close, and View Whiteboard**  
   Assign to roles (at least one) that should have the ability to launch or close the whiteboard. Users in these roles can view the whiteboard but cannot write or collaborate unless additional permissions are granted.

2. **Collaborate and View Whiteboard**  
   Assign to roles (at least one) that should have the ability to draw and collaborate on the whiteboard. Users in these roles can write, collaborate, and view the whiteboard. The whiteboard will automatically launch for them whenever it is initiated by someone with launch permissions.

3. **Only View Whiteboard**  
   Assign to roles that should only have the ability to view the whiteboard. These users cannot launch, close, or draw on the whiteboard unless further permissions are assigned. The whiteboard will automatically launch for them when initiated by someone with launch permissions.

> **Note on Multiple Permissions**
>
> A role can be assigned multiple permission levels. For example, a **‘teacher’** role can have both the 'Launch, Close, and View Whiteboard' and 'Collaborate and View Whiteboard' permissions, allowing them to launch and write on the whiteboard.

### Integrating the Whiteboard
The Whiteboard is part of 100ms' Prebuilt SDK and is available across all platforms (iOS, Android, Flutter, React Native and Web). In case a more custom integration is desired within the SDK, use the following platform SDK specific guides:
- [iOS](/ios/v2/how-to-guides/set-up-video-conferencing/whiteboard)
- [Android](/android/v2/how-to-guides/extend-capabilities/whiteboard)
- [Web](/javascript/v2/how-to-guides/enable-content-sharing/collaborative-whiteboard)
- [React Native](/react-native/v2/how-to-guides/extend-capabilities/whiteboard)
- [Flutter](/flutter/v2/how-to-guides/extend-capabilities/whiteboard)

### Using the Whiteboard
Once you’ve enabled and saved the configuration, the Whiteboard can be launched by the peers with launch permissions on any supported device.

#### Default Behaviour
1. Although the Whiteboard supports infinite canvas, we have limited the canvas to the viewport on the device by restricting canvas movement.
2. Zoom-in and zoom-out functionality have been disabled on the Whiteboard in Prebuilt.
3. Changing of the page by one participant will change the page for all other participants. Decoupling this behaviour isn’t possible right now but support for this will come in the future.
4. The whiteboard, once launched, can only be closed by the peer who launched it. In case the peer disconnects or drops off, the whiteboard will close itself. Other peers with the required role permission can launch the whiteboard.
5. 

#### Features
The following features are supported within the Whiteboard:
1. Bottom Toolbar
2. Support for multiple pages
3. Export individual pages as PNGs
4. Image upload and annotation - Images can be upload by either drag-and-drop method or by clicking the ‘Assets’ icon in the bottom toolbar. This is only supported on web as of now.
5. Dark mode - This can be set locally for a user with collaborate permissions.

#### Errors
1. Timeout error will occur for the whiteboard in case the tab is left inactive for sometime.
2.
