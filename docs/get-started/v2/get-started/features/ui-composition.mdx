When a 100ms room is being [live streamed](./live-streaming) or [recorded](./recordings), the video output is a **composition** of tracks from all peers in the room. In 100ms, this is made possible through "Beam", which is an internal component that combines a web browser and a video encoder that composes video.

## How it works

The Beam web browser opens a web app, using a URL (also called "meeting URL"). This web app needs to use the [100ms web SDK](../../../../javascript/v2/quickstart/javascript-quickstart), so that it can [join a 100ms room](../../../../javascript/v2/how-to-guides/set-up-video-conferencing/join) and [render video](../../../../javascript/v2/how-to-guides/set-up-video-conferencing/render-video/overview) for peers in the room.

The web app is composing different tracks, and Beam ensures the rendered output is sent to the relevant destination (live stream, recording).

## Default composition

By default, 100ms live streams and recordings use [100ms pre-built links](../prebuilt/prebuilt) for composition. These links are auto-generated for every pair of role and room, and can be accessed from the dashboard or via [the API](../prebuilt/room-codes/room-links).

## Custom composition

Pre-built links are easy to use, but can be limited in customization. Since Beam can open any web app, you can customize the composition UI with HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

You can start from scratch or use the [100ms sample web app](../../../../javascript/v2/quickstart/react-sample-app/quickstart) (which is used by pre-built links) as a starting point for this customization.

### Things to note

While making your custom web app, ensure that the web app fulfills these conditions:

* Joins the room on page load: without any user interaction (for example, on a call preview screen) or authentication
* Joins the room within 10 secs of page load to satisfy the Beam health check

### Beam health check

Our job as software builders is to expect things can go wrong, and to ensure potential issues are gracefully handled with limited downstream impact. For example, a broken web app that cannot be opened in Beam could cause a broken live stream.

To ensure higher reliability, Beam is built on top of a JavaScript Bridge that can peak into the web app running in its browser to handle edge cases and more. Currently, this Bridge enables two benefits:

1. If the web app does not load correctly, it retries up to 3 times
    * A correct page load is defined as a "successful room join"
    * To fulfill this condition, your app must join the 100ms room successfully **within 10 seconds** of page load
1. Auto-stop when beam is the only one in the room
    * If all peers have left the room and there are no re-joins within 5 minutes, recording stops automatically
