## Guide to setup stream recordings

<StepsContainer id="stream-recording-setup">
### Setup stream recordings

Stream recordings can be enabled for your template through the 100ms Dashboard. Refer this section to [set up stream recordingsâ†’](/get-started/v2/get-started/features/recordings/set-up-recording)

### Start a stream recording

Once enabled for a template, stream recording gets **auto-started** when first peer joins the corresponding room. Stream recordings cannot be started from client side.

### stream recording events

1. 100ms notifies you when a recording starts for a stream with `stream.recording.started.success`event for every peer. 
2. A `stream.recording.failure` webhook event is sent if an individual stream recording fails.

### Get stream Assets
A successfully recorded stream generates a recording asset of type `stream`. Refer here for [all recording assets](/get-started/v2/get-started/features/recordings/recording-assets/recording-asset-types) types on 100ms. For successful stream recordings, get stream recording assets using

1. Get stream `asset_id`
	- Use **List recordings API** to retrieve all recordings.
	- **Using `stream.recording.success`** - triggered when a stream recording is completed for a peer
2. Get `id` of stream with type `stream` using either List Recording API or stream webhook events.
3. Store this `id` as corresponding asset identifier of the stream.
4. Call the Get Recording Asset API using the stream's `asset_id` to download the actual recording.

### Manage stream recordings

1. **Stop a stream recording** - Use Stop recording by id to stop a stream recoridng
2. **Pause a stream recording** - Use Pause a Recording API
3. **Resume a stream recording -** Use Resume a stream Recording API
