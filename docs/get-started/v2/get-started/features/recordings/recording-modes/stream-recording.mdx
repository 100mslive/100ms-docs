A stream recording combines the individual video and audio tracks for each participant into a single recording file. If the peer publishes his desktop, the screen share video track is generated as an additional stream recording asset. Stream Recording Assets are classified into three types:

- **Regular** - contains video track from camera input and audio track from microphone input
- **Screen** - contains video track from screen share (desktop) input; optionally can include audio track if they are published from desktop source.
- **Audio** - contains only the audio track from microphone input for audio only calls where video tracks were not published at all by the peer.

1. Stream recordings **start automatically** when the first peer joins a room, and stops automatically when the last peer leaves the room.
2. Recorded stream assets are of asset type `stream` and are available via Recording Asset APIs and stream recording webhook events.
3. At most there shall be only 2 stream recording assets for each peer
4. Recording assets will be available within a few minutes of a successful recording event

Some of the use cases of stream recoridng:
- Archival/Compliance purposes - Record a session for auditing at a later time.
- Any AI workflow integration to process individual peer's video and audio


## Guide to setup stream recordings

<StepsContainer id="stream-recording-setup">
### Setup stream recordings

Stream recordings can be enabled for your template through the 100ms Dashboard. Refer this section to [set up stream recordingsâ†’](/get-started/v2/get-started/features/recordings/set-up-recording)

### Start a stream recording

Once enabled for a template, stream recording gets **auto-started** when first peer joins the corresponding room. Stream recordings cannot be started from client side or REST APIs.

### Stream recording events

1. Once the recording is completed successfully, [stream.recording.success]((/docs/server-side/v2/how-to-guides/configure-webhooks/webhook#streamrecordingsuccess)) event is sent with the details on the recorded file path and associated metadata.
2. A [stream.recording.failure](/docs/server-side/v2/how-to-guides/configure-webhooks/webhook#streamrecordingfailure) webhook event is sent if an individual stream recording fails.

### Get stream Assets
A successfully recorded stream generates a recording asset of type `stream`. Refer here for [all recording assets](/get-started/v2/get-started/features/recordings/recording-assets/recording-asset-types) types on 100ms. For successful stream recordings, get stream recording assets using

1. Using [List recordings API](/docs/server-side/v2/api-reference/recording-assets/list-all-assets) get the all stream recording assets for a `session_id` and asset_type `stream`
2. Store the `id` as corresponding asset identifier of each stream.
3. Call the Get Presigned URL Asset API using the stream's `asset_id` to download the actual recording.
