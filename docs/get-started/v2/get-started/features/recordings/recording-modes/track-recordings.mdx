A track represents a single media stream published into the WebRTC session captured from a device's camera or microphone. Multiple tracks can be sent by each peer. Broadly, they are categorised into 2 types:

- **Video track** - contains video data captured from a video source such as a camera or desktop screen capture
- **Audio track** - contains audio data captured from an audio source such as a microphone

- Track recordings start automatically when the first peer joins a room, and stops automatically when the last peer leaves the room.
- Recorded track assets are of type track and are available via Recording Asset APIs and track webhook events.
- Multiple track recording assets can be available for a single peer. For example, for a 1:1 call for Peer A and Peer B, with both publishing audio, video and desktop screen, there shall be 3 track assets for each peer.
- Recording assets will be available within a few minutes of a successful recording event

Some of the use cases of recording a track:

- Integrating with custom composition workflows where tracks (video/audio) from specific participants are composed together in a single recording file.
- Integrating with AI workflows for transcription/ translation/ participant insights/ object detection.

## Guide to setup track recordings

Say there’s a 1:1 call where we want to record the Host and Co-Host tracks individually for a post production edit.

### Setup track recordings

Track recordings can be enabled for your template through the 100ms Dashboard. Refer this section to [set up track recordings→](/get-started/v2/get-started/features/recordings/set-up-recording)

### Start a track recording

Once enabled for a template, track recording gets auto-started when first peer joins the corresponding room. Track recordings cannot be started from client side or API.

### Track recording events

1. 100ms notifies you when a recording starts for each track with [track.recording.started.success](/docs/server-side/v2/how-to-guides/configure-webhooks/webhook#trackrecordingstartedsuccess) event for every peer. 
2. A [track.recording.failure](/docs/server-side/v2/how-to-guides/configure-webhooks/webhook#trackrecordingsuccess) webhook event is sent if an individual track recording fails.
3. A [track.recording.success](/docs/server-side/v2/how-to-guides/configure-webhooks/webhook#trackrecordingfailure) event is sent when all tracks of a peer are successfully recorded.

### Get Track Assets
A successfully recorded track generates a recording asset of type track. Refer here for [all recording assets](/get-started/v2/get-started/features/recordings/recording-assets/recording-asset-types) types on 100ms. For successful track recordings, get track recording assets using

1. Using [List recordings API](/server-side/v2/api-reference/recordings/list-all-recordings) get the all tracks recording assets for a `session_id` and asset_type `track`
2. Store the `id` as corresponding asset identifier of each track.
3. Call the Get Presigned URL Asset API using the track's `asset_id` to download the actual recording.
