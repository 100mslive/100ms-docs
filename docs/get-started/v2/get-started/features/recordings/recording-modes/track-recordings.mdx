A track represents a single media stream coming from a device like a camera or microphone. These tracks can be combined to generate a video file, which can have different tracks types such as:

- **Video track** - contains video data captured from a camera
- **Audio track** - contains audio data captured from a microphone

1. Track recordings **start automatically** when the first peer joins a room, and stops automatically when the last peer leaves the room.
2. Recorded track assets of type `track` are available via Rest APIs and track webhook events.
3. The final recording asset type will be individual `track` types  per peer present in the session. For example, for a 1:1 call for Peer A and Peer B, the recorded asset type tracks will be `audio` | `video`(includes screen-share) for each of them.

Some of the use cases of recording a track:
- Composing custom tracks (video/audio) from specific participants only as a single recording file
- Integrating with AI workflows for transcription/translation/ participant insights
- Integrating with workflows for object detection

## Guide to setup track recordings

Say there’s a 1:1 call where we want to record the Host and Co-Host tracks individually for a post production edit.

### Setup track recordings

Track recordings can be enabled for your template through the 100ms Dashboard. Refer this section to [set up track recordings→](/get-started/v2/get-started/features/recordings/set-up-recording)

### Start a track recording

Once enabled for a template, track recording gets **auto-started** when first peer joins the corresponding room. Track recordings cannot be started from client side.

### Track recording events

1. 100ms notifies you when a recording starts for each track with `track.recording.started.success`event for every peer. 
2. A `track.recording.failure` webhook event is sent if an individual track recording fails.
3. A `track.recording.success` event is sent when all tracks of a peer are successfully recorded.

### Get Track Assets
A successfully recorded track generates a recording asset of type `track`. Refer here for [all recording assets](/get-started/v2/get-started/features/recordings/recording-assets/recording-asset-types) types on 100ms. For successful track recordings, get track recording assets using

1. Get track `asset_id`
	- Use **[List recordings API](/server-side/v2/api-reference/recordings/list-all-recordings)** to retrieve all recordings.
	- Using `track.recording.success` event - triggered when a track recording is completed for a peer
2. Get `id` of tracks with type `track` using either List Recording API or track webhook events.
3. Store this `id` as corresponding asset identifier of the track.
4. Call the [Get Recording Asset API](/server-side/v2/api-reference/recordings/get-recording) using the track's `asset_id` to download the actual recording.

### Manage track recordings

1. **Stop a track recording** - Use Stop recording by id to stop a track recoridng
2. **Pause a track recording** - Use Pause a Recording API
3. **Resume a track recording -** Use Resume a Track Recording API
