# Migrate from SFU to Beam

There are 2 methods to get composite recordings in 100ms. If you have been using "SFU recording", we recommend you move over to using "Browser Composite Recordings".

### **Quick comparison**

| Features | Browser Composite | Custom/SFU (Legacy) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Asset type generated | room-composite  | room-composite-legacy |
| Recording method | Browser | SFU |
| Composition quality | Higher | Lower |
| Portrait/landscape mode | Available | Not available |
| Start method | Auto-start and on-demand | Auto start only |
| UI customization | Available | Not available |
| Role-specific recording | Available | Not available |
| Resolution | Customizable up to 1080p | 720p |

> **Note**
Another way to start SFU recording is to programmatically create a room using the **[Create Room REST API](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/api-reference/Rooms/create-via-api)** and passing `recording_info` object with `enabled` key set as `true`. Instead, we recommend to use the **[Room APIs](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/api-reference/Rooms/overview)** paired with the **[Recording APIs](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/api-reference/recordings/overview)** if you wish to programmatically control room and recording operations.
