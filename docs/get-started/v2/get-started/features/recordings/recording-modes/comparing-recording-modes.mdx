title: Comparing Recordings Modes

When creating an audio or video production, one of the first decisions is how to actually capture and record the raw footage and audio. The choice of recording mode will have significant impacts on quality, editing flexibility, viewer experience, and more down the line. But when should you use track vs stream vs composite recordings?

- **Track recordings** - Best used for creative post-productions editing, analyzing. Tracks recordings have high quality, smooth playback; allows full flexibility to edit each component separately.


- **Stream recordings** - Prioritizes real-time transmission and interactivity, fitting live broadcasts, video calls, and remote events where editing is less important.

- **Composite recordings** - Blends multiple signals like a podcast interview, striking a balance between live sharing and post-production; works for simpler video productions.


The key differences relate to editability, transmission method, number of source components, and viewer experience. Overall, choose track recording when post-production polish matters most, stream recording for live interactivity, and composite recording to blend components during the initial capture.


## Choosing a recording mode
Here is a table summarizing the key differences between track, stream, and composite recording modes across various aspects:

| Aspect | Track Recording | Stream Recording | Composite Recording |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Definition | Separate video track from webcam, audio track from microphone, recorded separately | Real-time encode & transmission of audio/video feed | Blended recording of multiple sources |
| Components | Single recording type e.g. one video track | Typically one video or audio stream | Multiple signals e.g. video + audio |
| Quality | High quality, allows post editing | Dependent on real-time conditions | Varies, edited version can be high quality |
| Use Cases | Post-production edits; movies, music albums | Video conferences, livestreaming events | Post-production edits; films, TV shows |
| Production | Flexible, remixing possible | Minimal post-processing | Mixing happens during recording |
| Viewer Experience | Smooth, consistent playback | Potential for lag or glitches | Seamless like track recordings |
| Transmission | Files transferred on demand | Continuous real-time feed | Files transmitted on-demand |
| Editing | Full editing of individual tracks | Hard to edit after broadcast | Final composite can be edited |

Choosing depends on what you need: a perfect finish, real-time sharing, or flexible editing. But having these recording options allows for more creativity and improved viewer experiences
