100ms can record a session to capture the perspective of a participant, who can hear and see other participants in the room.
These recordings are a composite of multiple audio/video tracks across multiple participants in the session. The output is a single MP4 file.
There are 2 types of Composite Recordings - Browser Composite and Custom Composite. Depending on the [use case](/get-started/v2/get-started/features/recordings/recording-modes/comparing-recording-modes), the ideal composite type can be selected.

### Enable Browser Composite Recordings
Set up browser composite recording using [recording configuration on 100ms dashboard →](/get-started/v2/get-started/features/recordings/set-up-recording)
	- Set up which roles to be recorded, video resolution, max recording duration time etc.
	- Audio-only browser composite recordings: possible via the **[REST API to start recording](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/how-to-guides/recordings/customize)**
	- **[Customize the composition UI](https://www.100ms.live/docs/get-started/v2/get-started/features/ui-composition)**

### Start a browser composite recording

There are two ways to record a browse composite recording

- Auto Start - Start recording automatically when the first peer joins a room. **[Enable on dashboard →](https://www.100ms.live/docs/docs/v2/auto-start-dashboard.png)**
- Start on demand
	- **Start with API** - Use 100ms server-side REST API which is suitable to start/stop based on business logic. Record with [Recording APIs →](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/how-to-guides/recordings/overview)

	- **Start from SDK** - Start recording with the client-side SDK. This is suitable to start/stop based on user action (click a button).

### Stop, pause, resume a browser composite recording

Browser composite recording can be started either by 100ms Recording APIs or SDKs, whereas actions like stop, pause, resume can be achieved with:
- Stop a recording - [Stop Recording API](/server-side/v2/api-reference/recordings/stop-recording-for-room)
- Pause a recording - [Pause Recording API](/server-side/v2/api-reference/recordings/pause-recording-for-room)
- Resume a recording - [Resume Recording API](/server-side/v2/api-reference/recordings/resume-recording-for-room)

### **Get browser composite recording assets**

After the recording is stopped and processed, a **[recording asset](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/api-reference/recording-assets/overview)** is generated. Composite generates an asset of type `room-composite`. You can fetch this asset through multiple methods:

- **[Fetch on 100ms Dashboard](https://www.100ms.live/docs/get-started/v2/get-started/features/recordings/storage#using-the-100ms-dashboard)**
- Auto-send to your **[cloud storage location](https://www.100ms.live/docs/get-started/v2/get-started/features/recordings/storage)**
- REST API to **[get recording asset](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/api-reference/recording-assets/get-asset)**
- Server-side webhooks: **[use the `beam.recording.success` webhook](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/how-to-guides/configure-webhooks/webhook#beamrecordingsuccess)**
