# Recording your live streams
This document is specifically for recording the **HLS streams**. To learn more about 100ms recordings in general, you can refer to [this document](/get-started/v2/get-started/features/recordings/overview).
100ms offers two major output formats for your HLS stream recordings. You can choose to record in *either* or *both* formats.

- [**Video-on-demand (VOD)** recording (M3U8)](#video-on-demand-vod-recording)
- [Single recording file per resolution layer (MP4)]()

> **Note - External Streaming**
> 
> Recordings of **External Streams (RTMP-Out)** are similar to `Room Composite Recording` and will be recorded in a single chosen resolution layer and generate a MP4 file. This recording will be a [recording asset]() of type `room-composite`. 

## **Video-on-demand** (VOD) recording (M3U8)
This recording is an M3U8 file (same playback format as HLS), which can be used for replaying your recorded HLS streams. This option is more suitable for Video-on-Demand use-cases as it has adaptive bitrate (ABR).

You need a special player like [the one from Akamai](https://players.akamai.com/players/hlsjs) to play a M3U8 file. 

### Configuring VOD recordings

1. Configure your recording storage. Use [this guide](/get-started/v2/get-started/features/recordings/storage) as your reference. Depending upon your choice of storage (100ms hosted or privately hosted), you will be met with slightly different options when configuring recording during live streams.
2. Enable and configure your live stream.
3. Enable and configure the `Stream Recording` settings on the 100ms dashboard.

> **Note** 
>
> You can also configure recording settings through the Policy API or provide a runtime configuration using the Live streams API.  


You can choose between zipped and unzipped VOD files upload during the configuration. By default, it will be unzipped.

>**Important Note - Zipped Recording Files **

> - For older templates with recordings hosted on 100ms, you have an option to switched from Zipped to Unzipped recording files upload, but you cannot switch back.
> - If you've hosted the recordings in your private cloud storage bucket, you will still have the option to choose between zipped or unzipped M3U8 file uploads.
> - If you're using 100ms storage, you cannot upload utilise the option of zipped M3U8 upload on any new templates.

## Single recording file per resolution layer (MP4)
Based on the chosen resolution layers for live streaming, you can choose to record all or selected resolution layers and generate a MP4 file for each of those layers. This can be done in the following way.
