# Recording your live streams
This document is specifically for recording the **HLS streams**. To learn more about 100ms recordings in general, you can refer to [this document](/get-started/v2/get-started/features/recordings/overview).
100ms offers two major output formats for your HLS stream recordings. You can choose to record in *either* or *both* formats.

> **Note - External Streaming**
> 
> Recordings of **External Streams (RTMP-Out)** are similar to `Room Composite Recording` and will be recorded in a single chosen resolution layer and generate a MP4 file. This recording will be a [recording asset]() of type `room-composite`. 



## Video-on-demand (VOD) recording (M3U8)
This recording is an M3U8 file (same playback format as HLS), which can be used for replaying your recorded HLS streams. This option is more suitable for Video-on-Demand use-cases as it has adaptive bitrate (ABR).

You need a special player like [the one from Akamai](https://players.akamai.com/players/hlsjs) to play a M3U8 file. 

### Configuring VOD recordings

1. Configure your recording storage. Use [this guide](/get-started/v2/get-started/features/recordings/storage) as your reference. Depending upon your choice of storage (100ms hosted or privately hosted), you will be met with slightly different options when configuring recording during live streams.
2. Enable and configure your live stream.
3. Enable and configure the `Stream Recording` settings under the `Live Streaming` tab on the 100ms dashboard.

> **Note** 
>
> You can also configure recording settings through the Policy API or provide a runtime configuration using the Live streams API.  

You can choose between zipped and unzipped VOD files upload during the configuration. By default, it will be unzipped.

| Default Template Configuration   | Unzipped M3U8                                                      | Unzipped M3U8                                        |
| Zipped Recording (M3U8) Upload   | Not available                                                      | Available                                            |
| Unzipped Recording (M3U8) Upload | Available                                                          | Available                                            |
| Direct VOD Playback (Via CDN)    | Yes, we host the recordings and provide you with CDN URL directly in our Recording Assets API. | No, you are required to set up your own CDN servers to allow on-demand playback. |

>**Important Note - Zipped Recording Files **
>
> - For all the templates created before <date> / <release>, the M3U8 file is zipped and uploaded, irrespective of the storage you've configured. 
> - For older templates with recordings hosted on 100ms, you have an option to switched from Zipped to Unzipped recording files upload, but you cannot switch back.
> - If you've hosted the recordings in your private cloud storage bucket, you will still have the option to choose between zipped or unzipped M3U8 file uploads.
> - If you're using 100ms storage, you cannot upload utilise the option of zipped M3U8 upload on any new templates.


### Fetching VOD recordings
There are effectively 3 methods for you to access and consume your recordings.

Tabs id="fetching-vod" items={['Recording Assets API','Webhooks','Dashboard']} />
    <Tab id='fetching-vod-0'>
    
    - All files generated after recording are called Recording Assets. These will include various video and stream recordings, chat, transcripts and summary. You can access these using the [Recording Assets API](/server-side/v2/api-reference/recording-assets/overview).
    - VOD Recording is generated as an asset type called `room-vod`. Depending upon your choice of zipped or unzipped uploads, you can access the path using the [GET recording asset API](/server-side/v2/api-reference/recording-assets/get-asset).
    - If you've configured 100ms as your cloud storage, you can also use [GET pre-signed URL API](/server-side/v2/api-reference/recording-assets/get-presigned-url) to get the CDN URL for on-demand playback by inputing it in a compatible player.
    - If you've configured your own storage, the

    <Tab id='fetching-vod-1'>
    
    - Create a webhook listener and configure the webhook using the Developer section of 100ms Dashboard. You can learn more about 100ms webhooks [here](/server-side/v2/how-to-guides/configure-webhooks/overview).
    - On the successful completion of the recording, you will receive a webhook event called `hls.recording.success` which will contain the path in the storage bucket (`hls_vod_recording_path`) and the CDN URL in `hls_vod_recording_presigned_url` (only if you're using 100ms storage).
    
    </Tab>

    <Tab id='fetching-vod-2'>

    To access the various recording assets including the recordings on the dashboard:

    1. Navigate to the `Sessions` tab in the sidebar to view previous sessions.
    2. Locate the sessions which you've recorded. The `Recording Status` column will indicate the status of the recording.
    3. Click on the `Completed` status of the chosen session ID.
    4. This will open the Session Details page. Access the `Recording Log` to find the available assets and view them.
    5. Click on `View Assets` to open a pop-up with pre-signed URLs for the recording, chat, transcripts, and summary.
    
    > Note 
    >
    > - If the template configured VOD Upload Format is zipped, your `room-vod` asset, which will be a zipped M3U8 file, will be downloaded. 
    > - If the selected storage is 100ms' and the VOD Upload Format is unzipped (default), you will be able to view the recording of the stream.
    > - If the configured storage is your cloud bucket and the VOD Upload Format is unzipped (default), you will be served with the following error toast:
    >   `The given VOD recording cannot be played because it is not hosted in 100ms storage. Use GET recording assets API to retrieve location of the recording in your configured storage.`

    </Tab>



## Single recording file per resolution layer (MP4)
Based on the chosen resolution layers for live streaming, you can choose to record all or selected resolution layers and generate a MP4 file for each of those layers. This can be done in the following way.

### Fetching the recordings
