Recordings enable you to convert live video from 100ms rooms into long-lived video assets. 100ms can generate different types of recordings:

## Recording modes for video conferencing

-   **[Track recordings](/get-started/v2/get-started/features/recordings/recording-modes/track-recordings)** - Record each audio and video track of each peer as separate assets.
-   **[Stream recordings](/get-started/v2/get-started/features/recordings/recording-modes/stream-recording)** - Record each peer's media streams (audio and video tracks combined) as separate assets.
-   **[Composite recordings](/get-started/v2/get-started/features/recordings/recording-modes/composite-recordings)** - Record as a single composed asset combining media tracks of all peers in the room

## Recording a livestream

Live stream recording enables capturing a continuous feed of audio or video in real-time during a live broadcast event. It focuses on low latency for interactivity over post-production flexibility. 100ms offers two recording formats:

-   **Video-On-Demand (VOD)**: Generated HLS file enables re-playable video with adaptive bitrates. Can be unzipped or zipped when storing.
-   **Per Layer MP4 Files**: Records separate MP4 videos for chosen resolution layers. Gives access to distinct raw footage files.

In summary, VOD recording is better for on-demand playback while Per Layer MP4's allow remixing footage. Choice depends on needs. But 100ms enables recording live streams in multiple ways maximizing flexibility. <br/>For more details, head to [Livestream recording →](/get-started/v2/get-started/features/recordings/live-stream-recording)
