Recordings enable you to convert live video from 100ms rooms into content assets. But the use of this asset varies from business to business depending on their respective use case.

100ms can generate different types of recordings

- Composite recordings `room-composite` 
    - Also available as `room-composite-legacy` - from SFU
- Peer and track level recordings
- Video-on-demand (VOD) recordings
- `chat` 

If you using live streaming or external streaming, you can record the stream. For live stream with HLS, 100ms can generate  

Based on your end goal, you can choose one of the recording types and its implementation. You can understand some key differences using the comparison table below.

## Basic recording

## Recording types

### Room Composite Recording `room-composite`

> Earlier called beam or browser recording.

Capabilities

- customization
  - choose which roles to be recorded
  - specify UI to be recorded
    - custom UI composition
  - customize resolution or get audio-only
- methods
  - auto start and auto stop

Browser recording is built to give users a participant-first recording experience. When enabled, our browser-based bot Beam joins a room to record the viewport like any other participant. The output is an MP4 file that captures the room's published audio/video tracks together into one single file. This option removes the complexity of syncing various audio/video tracks and offers an intuitive, participant-first recording experience. An example use case is to record a sales meeting for later usage.

### SFU Recording [Advanced]

SFU recording is built for advanced use cases, which require individual audio and video tracks for each participant. This recording option allows you to isolate recording at a participant level. Track recording allows you to record audio and video streams separately, making it easier to edit, layer, or reuse each of them. An example use case is to record a live podcast and later edit it for publishing.

You can get track recordings in two forms:

- Individual: Media for each peer is provided as a separate mp4 file. This file will have both audio and video of the peer. These files can be used for offline review or in implementing custom composition.

- Composite [currently in beta]: Audio and video of all peers are composed as per their joining/leaving the meeting and provided as a single mp4. This file can be used for offline viewing of the meeting.

* `room-composite-legacy` type

### Peer and track 

only possible for SFU

### Recordings for Live Streaming Use-cases

These are the types of live streaming recordings:

#### Video-on-demand Recording

Video-on-demand recording is available for our Interactive Live Streaming capability. This recording will be a file with an M3U8 file (same playback format as HLS), which can be used for replaying your HLS stream. This option is more suitable for Video-on-Demand use cases. For the implementation of this type of recording, please [contact us](https://www.100ms.live/contact).

* `room-vod` type 

- can i start this without recording API

#### Multiresolution Recording

A multi-resolution recording is available for Interactive Live Streaming capability. This type of recording will have a multi-file structure for all available resolutions of the stream. The output will be multiple MP4 files with these resolutions: 240p, 480p, 720p, and 1080p. For an implementation of this type of recording, please [contact us](https://www.100ms.live/contact).

* `room-composite` type

## Chat Recording

Chat recording is a feature through which you will receive all chats messages sent by peers during the SFU/browser recording. Chat recording is available for both SFU recording and browser recording. Only chats sent to some or all roles will be recorded. The `.csv` file will be uploaded to the recording bucket configured for your video recordings. The file header will be: `SenderPeerID,SenderName,SenderUserID,Roles,SentAt,Type,Message`

**Header information**

| Header | Description |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SenderPeerID |Sender's peer id |
| SenderName | Sender's name |
| SenderUserID | Sender's user id |
| Roles | Roles to which the message is sent; `[]` in case of all roles |
| SentAt| SentAt in RFC.3339 format |
| Type| Message type - `chat`|
| Message| Message that was sent |

**Chat recording path is available in following webhook responses:**

- Browser Recording: [beam.recording.success](/server-side/v2/introduction/webhook#beamrecordingsuccess) (attribute: `chat_recording_path` ; `chat_recording_presigned_url`)
- SFU Recording: [recording.success](/server-side/v2/introduction/webhook#sfu-recording-events) (attribute: `chat_recording_path` ; `chat_recording_presigned_url`)
- Multiresolution Recording: [hls.recording.success](/server-side/v2/introduction/webhook#hlsrecordingsuccess) (attribute: `chat_recording_path` ; `chat_recording_presigned_url`)

**The recording path for these respective recordings will look like follows:**

`s3://<location>/<prefix>/chat/<room_id>/<start_date>/Rec-<room_id>-<epoch>.csv`

**The breakdown of the aforementioned tags is as follows:**

| Tag Name    | Description |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Location    | Name of the bucket where recordings are stored |
| Prefix      | Prefix for upload path which is configured in storage settings of your template. If not configured, the default value for this will be your Customer ID |
| Room ID     | The identifier for the room which was recorded |
| Start Date  | Start date of the session |
| Epoch       | Start time of the recorder in the session |
