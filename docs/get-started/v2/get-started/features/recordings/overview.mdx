Recordings enable you to convert live video from 100ms rooms into long-lived video assets. 100ms can generate different types of recordings

- [Composite recordings](#composite-recordings): One video file, composed with tracks of all peers in the room
- [Track recordings](#track-recordings): Separate media files for audio, video and screen-share tracks

## Composite recordings

> Previously called browser or beam recording.

100ms can record a room to capture the perspective of a participant, who can hear and see other participants in the room. These recordings are a mix of multiple audio/video tracks, composed together in one video file—with a layout that is similar to the UI of the room. The output is a single MP4 file.

Composite recordings can be customized: you can define which roles to record, which video resolution to record and, other modifications to the UI.

Internally, these recordings are created using an automated web browser that joins the room as a hidden peer (called "beam")—which records the screen to generate a composite recording.

### Start and stop recording

Enable "room composite recordings" on any template created on the [100ms Dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live). This enables the feature for your template, and exposes options to customize the recording. You can control when to **start and stop** recording, based on your use-case.

There are 3 methods to start a recording.

<FlexContainer>

<Callout icon="link" title="Auto-start">
Start recording automatically when the first peer joins a room.

[Enable on dashboard →](/docs/v2/auto-start-dashboard.png)

</Callout>

<Callout icon="link" title="Start with API">
Start recording by calling the 100ms server-side REST API. This is suitable to start/stop based on business logic.
<br/>

[REST API docs →](/server-side/v2/how-to-guides/recordings/overview)

</Callout>

<Callout icon="shield" title="Start from SDK">
Start recording with the client-side SDK. This is suitable to start/stop based on user action (click a button).

### Fetch the recording

After the recording is stopped and processed, a [recording asset](/server-side/v2/api-reference/recording-assets/overview) is generated. Composite generates an asset of type `room-composite`. You can fetch this asset through multiple methods:

* [Fetch on 100ms Dashboard](./storage#using-the-100ms-dashboard)
* Auto-send to your [cloud storage location](./storage)
* REST API to [get recording asset](/server-side/v2/api-reference/recording-assets/get-asset)
* Server-side webhooks: [use the `beam.recording.success` webhook](/server-side/v2/how-to-guides/configure-webhooks/webhook#beamrecordingsuccess)

### Customizing the recording

- No-code customization on the 100ms Dashboard: Modify the video resolution, which roles to be recorded
- Get audio-only recording: possible via the [REST API to start recording](/server-side/v2/how-to-guides/recordings/customize)
- [Customize the composition UI](/get-started/v2/get-started/features/ui-composition)

### Legacy composite through SFU recording

100ms has an alternative method to generate a composite video. This method is not recommended since above described method generates a higher quality video.

SFU recording generates the asset type called `room-composite-legacy`.

See [migration doc](./migrating) to compare these 2 methods and pick a preferred approach.

### Recording with live streaming

If you using live streaming or external streaming, you can enable recording while starting the stream. For live stream with HLS, 100ms can generate 2 types of recordings. Learn more about recording with a live stream [here](/get-started/v2/get-started/features/recordings/live-stream-recording).

#### Video-on-demand (VOD) Recording

This recording is an M3U8 file (same playback format as HLS), which can be used for replaying your HLS stream. This option is more suitable for Video-on-Demand use-cases as it has adaptive bitrate (ABR). You can learn more about VOD and its implementation [here](/get-started/v2/get-started/features/recordings/live-stream-recording#video-on-demand-vod-recording-m3u8).

- Enable recording while starting a live stream: through the [server-side REST API](/server-side/v2/api-reference/live-streams/start-live-stream-for-room) or via a client SDK
- This generates a recording asset with `room-vod` type. Use the server-side [REST API to fetch the asset](/server-side/v2/api-reference/recording-assets/get-asset)

#### Single file per layer

This type of recording will generate multiple video files: one for each resolution layer of the live stream.

- Enable recording while starting a live stream: through the [server-side REST API](/server-side/v2/api-reference/live-streams/start-live-stream-for-room) or via a client SDK
- This generates multiple recording assets with `room-composite` type. Use the server-side [REST API to fetch the assets](/server-side/v2/api-reference/recording-assets/get-asset)

## Track recordings

Some use-cases require 1 file per 1 track (audio, video or screen-share). This can be generated through the SFU recording.

Track recordings can be enabled for your template through the 100ms Dashboard. Once enabled, the recording **starts automatically** when the first peer joins a room, and stops automatically when the last peer leaves the room.

![SFU recording on 100ms Dashboard](/docs/v2/sfu-recording-dashboard.png)

### Fetch the recording

You can fetch track recordings through two methods:

* Auto-send to your [cloud storage location](./storage)
* Server-side webhooks: use the `track.recording.success` webhook
