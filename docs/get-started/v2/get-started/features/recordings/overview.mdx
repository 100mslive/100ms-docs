Recordings enable you to convert live video from 100ms rooms into long-lived media assets. 100ms can generate different types of recordings

- [Composite recordings](#composite-recordings): One video file, composed with tracks of all peers in the room
- [Track recordings](#track-recordings): Separate media files for audio, video and screen-share tracks

## Composite recordings

This asset type is `room-composite`.

> Earlier called browser recording. This recording type is built with a browser, and has a peer join the call. Peer is called beam. 

Browser recording is built to give users a participant-first recording experience. When enabled, our browser-based bot Beam joins a room to record the viewport like any other participant. The output is an MP4 file that captures the room's published audio/video tracks together into one single file. This option removes the complexity of syncing various audio/video tracks and offers an intuitive, participant-first recording experience. An example use case is to record a sales meeting for later usage.

### Fetch the recording

### Customizing the recording

- customization
  - choose which roles to be recorded
  - specify UI to be recorded
    - custom UI composition
  - customize resolution or get audio-only

### Legacy composite

This asset type is `room-composite-legacy`. SFU recording. Quality of composition is inferior.

See [migration doc](./migrating)


### Recording with live streaming

If you using live streaming or external streaming, you can record the stream. For live stream with HLS, 100ms can generate


#### Video-on-demand Recording

Video-on-demand recording is available for our Interactive Live Streaming capability. This recording will be a file with an M3U8 file (same playback format as HLS), which can be used for replaying your HLS stream. This option is more suitable for Video-on-Demand use cases. For the implementation of this type of recording, please [contact us](https://www.100ms.live/contact).

* `room-vod` type 

- can i start this without recording API

#### Multi-resolution Recording

A multi-resolution recording is available for Interactive Live Streaming capability. This type of recording will have a multi-file structure for all available resolutions of the stream. The output will be multiple MP4 files with these resolutions: 240p, 480p, 720p, and 1080p. For an implementation of this type of recording, please [contact us](https://www.100ms.live/contact).

* `room-composite` type



## Track recordings

SFU recording is built for advanced use cases, which require individual audio and video tracks for each participant. This recording option allows you to isolate recording at a participant level. Track recording allows you to record audio and video streams separately, making it easier to edit, layer, or reuse each of them. An example use case is to record a live podcast and later edit it for publishing.

You can get track recordings in two forms:

- Individual: Media for each peer is provided as a separate mp4 file. This file will have both audio and video of the peer. These files can be used for offline review or in implementing custom composition.

- Composite [currently in beta]: Audio and video of all peers are composed as per their joining/leaving the meeting and provided as a single mp4. This file can be used for offline viewing of the meeting.

only possible for SFU
