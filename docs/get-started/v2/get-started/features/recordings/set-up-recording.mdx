### Configure your recordings
You can configure how to record your files with certain configurations

#### Storage for Recording Assets
You have two storage options for recording assets:
- **Self-storage** - Configure a cloud storage location (for example AWS S3 or GCS) under the storage configuration in your template. By default, 100ms will upload any generated recording assets to this defined location. [Set up storage configuration](/get-started/v2/get-started/features/recordings/recording-assets/storage-configuration) to use this option.
- **Store with 100ms** - If no custom cloud storage is configured, any generated recording assets are uploaded to 100ms storage buckets allocated for your account. By default, there is limited 15 day retention. The validity period of these recordings can be configured using the Get Recording Link API. <br/>

For more details, refer [storage configuration](get-started/v2/get-started/features/recordings/recording-assets/storage-configuration)
