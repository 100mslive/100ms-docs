100ms can upload recordings to your preferred cloud storage location. We support these providers:

- Amazon Simple Storage Service (AWS S3)
- Google Cloud Storage (GCP)
- Alibaba Object Storage (OSS)

If you don't configure a cloud storage service, then recordings will be stored temporarily (for 15 days) in a storage location managed by 100ms. Post a successful recording, the recording asset can be accessed on the [100ms dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/sessions) or [through the REST API](/server-side/v2/api-reference/recording-assets/get-asset).

## Configure storage

### On the 100ms Dashboard

You can configure storage in your template's recording settings on the 100ms Dashboard. As an example, this is how you would configure an S3 location:

1. Generate your credentials; for this example, you can check out a [guide from AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html). You can skip this step if you already have credentials. Please note that if you are running a Browser recording, you need to give upload permission to your key, but if you are running an SFU recording, you need to give both upload and download permission.

2. Go to 100ms Dashboard and go to template **configuration by selecting the configure icon**.

3. Head over to the **Destinations** tab.

1. Key in your credentials (using an example of an S3 bucket here):

    - Access Key: Access Key generated from AWS IAM Console
    - Secret Key: Secret Key generated from AWS IAM Console
    - Bucket: Name of the bucket in S3
    - Region: Name of the region, for example, ap-south-1
    - Prefix for Upload Path: Define the directory name (optional)

5. Use the **Validate Config** button to test your storage setup.

6. You will see a message that the AWS **configuration was successfully validated**.

The above message ensures that your configuration is successful now, and all your recordings will start collecting in your configured destination.

### With the REST API

Use the [Policy API](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/api-reference/policy/create-template-via-api) to programmatically configure your storage location.

You can configure the **`type`** field of recording object to `s3` for AWS, `oss` for Alibaba Object Storage Service and `gs` for Google Cloud Storage with the following details:

- Access Key: Access Key for your OSS/GCP Bucket
- Secret Key: Secret Key for your OSS/GCP Bucket
- Bucket: Name of the bucket
- Region: Name of the region where your bucket is located in
- Prefix for Upload Path: Define the directory name (optional)

## Fetching the asset

### Using the 100ms Dashboard

You can access your recordings on the [sessions page](https://dashboard.100ms.live/sessions) in the 100ms Dashboard.

### Using the REST API

Recordings generate [recording assets](/server-side/v2/api-reference/recording-assets/overview) that can be fetched with the REST API.

### Get webhooks

100ms can send webhooks when the recording has stopped and is available for download. The recording path is available in following webhook responses:

- Room composite (also called browser) recording: [beam.recording.success](/server-side/v2/introduction/webhook#beamrecordingsuccess) (attribute: `recording_path`)
- Room composite - legacy (also called SFU) recording: [recording.success](/server-side/v2/introduction/webhook#sfu-recording-events) (attribute: `recording_path`)
- Recordings enabled with live streaming (HLS): [hls.recording.success](/server-side/v2/introduction/webhook#hlsrecordingsuccess)

### Path formats

The recording path for these respective recordings will look like:

1. Room composite (also called browser) recording: `s3://<location>/<prefix>/beam/<room_id>/<start_date>/Rec-<room_id>-<epoch>.mp4`

2. Room composite - legacy (also called SFU) recording:

    1. Composite: `s3://<location>/<prefix>/<room_id>/<start_date>/<session_id>/Rec-<session_id>-<epoch>.mp4`

    2. Individual: `s3://<location>/<prefix>/<room_id>/<start_date>/<session_id>/<peer_id>/<stream_id>/<track_id>.webm`

3. Multi-resolution recording (available in HLS): `s3://<location>/<prefix>/hls/<room_id>/<start_date>/<epoch>/file-recording/Rec-<room_id>-<epoch>-<layer_index>.mp4`

4. VOD recording (available in HLS): `s3://<location>/<prefix>/hls/<room_id>/<start_date>/<epoch>/vod/Rec-<room_id>-<epoch>.zip`
