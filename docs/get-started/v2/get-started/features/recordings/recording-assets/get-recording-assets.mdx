To download a recording asset, you can use the Get Recording Asset API with the asset_id identifier. Asset Identifier are available in the recording webhooks for each mode and for each asset.
Alternatively, Use List recordings Assets API for a session or room to get asset_ids and associated metadata of all recording assets for the session


## List recording Assets

The [List Recording Assets API](/server-side/v2/api-reference/recording-assets/list-all-assets) which returns `asset_id`s for recordings generated across your 100ms workspace, which can be filtered by:

- Session ID - list all recordings for a `session_id`. 
- Room ID - list all recordings for a `room_id`
- Type - Asset types such as `track`, `stream`, `room-composite`
- Recording status, where `status` can be:
	- `completed` - get only completed recordings
	- `failed` - get only failed recordings
<br/>
If no filter is specified, all recordings for your workspace will be returned. The `id` returned in the response refers to the asset generated, which contains information such as associated session, room, asset type, status, duration, etc. Refer to the [recording asset object specification](/server-side/v2/api-reference/recording-assets/overview#object) for details.
