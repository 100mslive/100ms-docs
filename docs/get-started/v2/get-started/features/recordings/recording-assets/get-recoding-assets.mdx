To download a recording asset, you first need to obtain its unique asset_id identifier. List recordings to get asset_id and use the asset_id to get the recorded asset


## List recordings

The [List Recordings API](/v2/api-reference/recording-assets/list-all-assets) which returns `asset_id`s for recordings generated across your 100ms workspace, which can be filtered by:

- Session ID - list all recordings for a `session_id`. 
- Room ID - list all recordings for a `room_id`
- Recording status, where `status` can be:
	- `completed` - get only completed recordings
	- `failed` - get only failed recordings
<br/>
If no filtered is specified, all recordings for your workspace will be returned. The `id` returned in the response refers to the asset generated, which contains information such as associated session, room, asset type, status, duration, etc. Refer to the [recording asset object specification]((/server-side/v2/api-reference/recording-assets/overview#object)) for details.


## Get a recording asset

- Use [Get recording asset API](/server-side/v2/api-reference/recording-assets/get-asset) using an `asset_id`.
