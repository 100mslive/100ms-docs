100ms can upload your recordings to your preferred cloud storage location. We support the following providers:

- Amazon Simple Storage Service (AWS S3)
- Google Cloud Storage (GCP)
- Alibaba Object Storage (OSS)
- Azure Blob Storage

By default, recordings will be stored temporarily (for 15 days) in a storage location managed by 100ms if nothing is configured. Post a successful recording, the recording assets can be accessed on the [100ms dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/sessions) or [through the REST API](/server-side/v2/api-reference/recording-assets/get-asset).

## Configure recording storage

<Tabs id="configure-storage" items={['Dashboard','REST API']} />

<Tab id='configure-storage-0'>

You can configure storage in your template's `Recording` tab on the 100ms Dashboard. As an example, this is how you would configure a GCP location:

<br/>
<video loop="true" controls="controls" id="vid">
    <source src="https://storage.googleapis.com/100ms-cms-prod/cms/Storage_Configuration_0f8798fee3/Storage_Configuration_0f8798fee3.mp4?updated_at=2023-09-26T15:27:18.214Z" type="video/mp4" />
</video>
<br/>

1. Generate your credentials; for this example, you can check out a [guide from AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html). Skip this step if you already have credentials. 
    
    > **Note**
    > 
    > If you are using [Room Composite recording](/get-started/v2/get-started/features/recordings/overview#composite-recordings), you need to give upload permission to your key, but if you are using the [SFU legacy recording](/get-started/v2/get-started/features/recordings/overview#legacy-composite-through-sfu-recording), you need to give both upload and download permissions.

2. Go to 100ms Dashboard and go to template configuration by selecting **'Configure'** under **Templates**. The below image shows two options to access template configuration.

![configure template](/docs/v2/configure-template.png)

3. Head over to the **Recording** tab.

4. Key in your credentials (using an example of an Google Cloud Services (GCP) bucket here):

    - **Access Key**: Access Key generated from GCP IAM Console
    - **Secret Key**: Secret Key generated from GCP IAM Console
    - **Bucket**: Name of the bucket in GCP
    - **Region**: Name of the region, for example, asia-south1
    - **Prefix for Upload Path**: Define the directory name (optional)

5. Click on the **Validate** button to test your storage setup.

6. A toast with the message 'Recording upload config validated successfully' will pop-up in the top right. This confirms that the configuration is successful.

7. Save your updated settings.

</Tab>

<Tab id='configure-storage-1'>

Use the [Policy API](https://www.100ms.live/docs/server-side/v2/api-reference/policy/create-template-via-api) to programmatically configure your storage location.

You can configure the **`type`** field of recording object to `s3` for AWS, `oss` for Alibaba Object Storage Service, `gs` for Google Cloud Storage, and `azure` for Azure Blob Storage with the following details:

- Access Key: Access Key for your storage bucket (for Azure, use the Storage Account Name)
- Secret Key: Secret Key for your storage bucket (for Azure, use the Storage Account Key)
- Bucket: Name of the bucket (for Azure, use the Container Name)
- Region: Name of the region where your bucket is located in (for Azure, this field is not required)
- Prefix for Upload Path: Define the directory name (optional)

</Tab>

## Fetching your recording assets

<Tabs id="fetch-recordings" items={['Dashboard','REST API','Webhooks']} />

<Tab id='fetch-recordings-0'>

You can access your recordings on the [sessions page](https://dashboard.100ms.live/sessions) in the 100ms Dashboard.

![Recording Links](/docs/v2/recording-links-session.png)

</Tab>

<Tab id='fetch-recordings-1'>

Recordings generate [recording assets](/server-side/v2/api-reference/recording-assets/overview) that can be fetched with the REST API.

</Tab>

<Tab id='fetch-recordings-2'>

100ms can send webhooks when the recording has stopped and is available for download. The recording path is available in following webhook responses:

- Room composite recording: [beam.recording.success](/server-side/v2/introduction/webhook#beamrecordingsuccess) (attribute: `recording_path`)
- Room composite - legacy recording (SFU recording): [recording.success](/server-side/v2/introduction/webhook#sfu-recording-events) (attribute: `recording_path`)
- HLS Recording: [hls.recording.success](/server-side/v2/introduction/webhook#hlsrecordingsuccess)

</Tab>

### Path formats

The recording path for these respective recordings will look like:

1. Room composite recording: `s3://<location>/<prefix>/beam/<room_id>/<start_date>/Rec-<room_id>-<epoch>.mp4`

2. Room composite - legacy recording (SFU recording):

    1. Composite: `s3://<location>/<prefix>/<room_id>/<start_date>/<session_id>/Rec-<session_id>-<epoch>.mp4`

    2. Individual: `s3://<location>/<prefix>/<room_id>/<start_date>/<session_id>/<peer_id>/<stream_id>/<track_id>.webm`

3. HLS recording - Multi-resolution layer: `s3://<location>/<prefix>/hls/<room_id>/<start_date>/<epoch>/file-recording/Rec-<room_id>-<epoch>-<layer_index>.mp4`

4. HLS recording - Zipped Video-on-demand: `s3://<location>/<prefix>/hls/<room_id>/<start_date>/<epoch>/vod/Rec-<room_id>-<epoch>.zip`
