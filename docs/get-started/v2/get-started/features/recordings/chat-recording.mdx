100ms can record chat messages sent in a room when a [video recording](./overview) is used. Chat messages that are broadcasted to the room or sent to a role are recorded (direct messages are not recorded).


Chat recording generates a `.csv` file, which will be uploaded to the [storage bucket](./storage) configured for your video recordings.

## File structure

The file header will be: `SenderPeerID,SenderName,SenderUserID,Roles,SentAt,Type,Message`

**Header information**

| Header | Description |
| ----------- | ------ |
| SenderPeerID |Sender's peer id |
| SenderName | Sender's name |
| SenderUserID | Sender's user id |
| Roles | Roles to which the message is sent; `[]` in case of all roles |
| SentAt| SentAt in RFC.3339 format |
| Type| Message type - `chat`|
| Message| Message that was sent |

### With the REST API

Recordings generate [recording assets](/server-side/v2/api-reference/recording-assets/overview) that can be fetched with the REST API.

### With webhooks

100ms can send webhooks when the recording has stopped and is available for download. The recording path is available in following webhook responses:

- Browser Recording: [beam.recording.success](/server-side/v2/introduction/webhook#beamrecordingsuccess) (attribute: `chat_recording_path` ; `chat_recording_presigned_url`)
- SFU Recording: [recording.success](/server-side/v2/introduction/webhook#sfu-recording-events) (attribute: `chat_recording_path` ; `chat_recording_presigned_url`)
- Multiresolution Recording: [hls.recording.success](/server-side/v2/introduction/webhook#hlsrecordingsuccess) (attribute: `chat_recording_path` ; `chat_recording_presigned_url`)

### Path structure

The recording path will look like:

`s3://<location>/<prefix>/chat/<room_id>/<start_date>/Rec-<room_id>-<epoch>.csv`

**The breakdown of the aforementioned tags is as follows:**

| Tag Name    | Description |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Location    | Name of the bucket where recordings are stored |
| Prefix      | Prefix for upload path which is configured in storage settings of your template. If not configured, the default value for this will be your Customer ID |
| Room ID     | The identifier for the room which was recorded |
| Start Date  | Start date of the session |
| Epoch       | Start time of the recorder in the session |
