There are 2 methods to get composite recordings in 100ms. If you have been using "SFU recording", we recommend you move over to using "Room composite recordings".

> **Note**
>
> Another way to start SFU recording is to programmatically create a room using the [Create Room REST API](/server-side/v2/api-reference/Rooms/create-via-api) and passing `recording_info` object with `enabled` key set as `true`. Instead, we recommend to use the [Room APIs](/server-side/v2/api-reference/Rooms/overview) paired with the [Recording APIs](/server-side/v2/api-reference/recordings/overview) if you wish to programmatically control room and recording operations.

### How-to migrate

Migrating to room composite recordings is just a few toggles of work on the 100ms Dashboard.
