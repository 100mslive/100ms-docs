### Setting up
1. Go to [100ms dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/dashboard) and move to an existing template or create a new one.
2. Enable polls and quizzes functionality on your template using role permissions.

| Permissions | Description | Host | Guest | 
| ------| ----------- | -------- | -------- |
| Can write Polls/Quizzes | Akin to a Poll Initiator - Can create a Poll - Can start/stop a Poll  | True | False |
| Can read Polls/Quizzes | Can | True | True |


### Creating questions  
Hosts have two options for conducting polls or quizzes in live sessions. For instant or unplanned feedback, hosts can create real-time polls or quizzes during the session. Alternatively, when hosts intend to engage participants with a series of polls or quizzes throughout the session, it's advisable to prepare the questions in advance and save their time typing questions. Depending on how Hosts want to engage the room, follow these steps for your type integration:

<Tabs id="implementation" items={['100ms Prebuilt','Custom UI with SDKs']} />

<Tab id='implementation-0'>
   - **Create questions real-time** - Hosts can create questions on the go from the Polls menu on 100ms Prebuilt  
   - **Pre-create questions** - Create questions before the session starts using [Create Poll API] and link the poll/quiz to an existing or a new room. When using 100ms Prebuilt, any polls linked to a room will be automatically fetched to its associated sessions.

### Ending a poll or quiz with results
1. There are three ways to end a live poll or quiz:
    - a Host can end a live poll/quiz for everyone in the room.
    - if the duration is set while creating poll/quiz, it ends automatically when the timer completes.
    - it ends when all participants leave the room or the session ends.
2. Once a poll or quiz ends, no further votes are accounted for in the final results. The live status view now changes to an ended view summarising the voting and answers submitted from participants; this view differs for roles
