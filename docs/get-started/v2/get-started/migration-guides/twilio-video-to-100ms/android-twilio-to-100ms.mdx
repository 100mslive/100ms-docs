This guide is designed to assist developers in migrating their video conferencing applications from Twilio's Programmable Video SDK to the 100ms Video SDK on Android.

Before we get started here, you are required to create an account on 100ms. 

Learn more about the fundamental differences and parities between 100ms and Twilio Programmable Video [here](/get-started/v2/get-started/migration-guides/twilio-video-to-100ms/overview#feature-map-comparison). 

100ms uses a single SDK for all features, including audio/video conferencing, chat, and recording.
