title: Flutterflow QuickStart Guide
nav: 2.7
---

This Flutter template provides a solid foundation for building feature-rich mobile applications by combining the power of FlutterFlow and HMS Room Kit for real-time communication capabilities.
This guide will walk you through simple instructions to create a video conferencing/streaming application using flutterflow and 100ms prebuilt.

> Explore the HMSRoomKit X Flutterflow sample project [here](https://app.flutterflow.io/project/hms-room-kit-sample-lvsfde?tab=customCode&customCodeTab=widgets).
> Checkout the github repo with flutterflow integration [here](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-flutter/tree/FLUT-204/sample%20apps/flutterflow-prebuilt-quickstart)

## Features

- **FlutterFlow Integration:** Leverage FlutterFlow's intuitive visual development platform to design stunning user interfaces for your Flutter app effortlessly.

- **HMS Room Kit:** Integrate 100ms HMS Room Kit for seamless real-time communication features such as instant messaging, audio, and video calls into your Flutter application.

## Prerequisites

- A [100ms account](https://dashboard.100ms.live/register) if you don't have one already.
- A [Flutterflow account](https://app.flutterflow.io/create-account) if you don't have one already
- Flutterflow subscription plan to test the application locally.


## Getting started

Follow these steps to setup and run the project:

1. Setup basic widgets required for your application in flutterflow, Follow the flutterflow docs [here](https://docs.flutterflow.io/getting-started/resources)

2. Create a custom widget in flutterflow, checkout the docs to create custom widget [here](https://docs.flutterflow.io/customizing-your-app/custom-functions/custom-widgets)

3. Add `hms_room_kit` in `Pubspec dependencies` section.

4. In your custom widget add the `HMSPrebuilt` widget and pass the room code:

```dart
HMSPrebuilt(roomCode: "Enter your room code here");
```

That's it now you can run the  application and test it out.

> Flutterflow currently runs the application on flutter web, since `hms_room_kit` does not support flutter web you will need to 
> download the code and run it locally on your machine.

## Known issues

`hms_room_kit` manages state and UI out of the box, but there are some conflicts with flutterflow. So, we need to make some changes in the app layer. Please follow the steps below to run the app:

1. Solving dependency conflicts:

<img width="526" alt="Screenshot 2023-11-20 at 11 00 18 AM" src="https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-flutter/assets/93931528/810b96ca-d268-4681-b073-56b4df35de51"/>

There are several packages which are common in both `flutterflow` and `hms_room_kit`, but with different versions. So, we need to make sure that the versions of these packages are same in both `pubspec.yaml` files. For conflict in packages you will get error like this:

```bash
Error: Failed running flutter pub get...
Because custom_widget depends on flutter_cache_manager 3.3.0 which depends on http ^0.13.0, http ^0.13.0 is required.
So, because custom_widget depends on http ^1.0.0, version solving failed.


You can try the following suggestion to make the pubspec resolve:
* Try upgrading your constraint on flutter_cache_manager: flutter pub add flutter_cache_manager:^3.3.1
```

This can be solved by updating to the higher version of the package. For example, in the above error, we need to update `flutter_cache_manager` to `^3.3.1` in `pubspec.yaml` file.

> 🔑 Note: Flutterflow UI doesn't directly allow changing the package version, either you need to do it in `Custom Widgets` section or you can download the code from Flutterflow and change the version in `pubspec.yaml` file locally. We recommend doing the later since it's much easier.

2. Issues with Navigator:

Flutterflow uses `go_router` whereas `hms_room_kit` uses `MaterialPageRoute` for navigation. So, you might face issues while navigating from app screen to `hms_room_kit` screen. To solve this, you will need to use `MaterialPageRoute` while pushing the `hms_room_kit` path while you can continue using `go_router` for other paths.

That's it. You can now use the amazing Prebuilt UI with speed of Flutterflow in your application.

## Next steps

We have multiple example apps to get you started with 100ms Flutter SDK.
