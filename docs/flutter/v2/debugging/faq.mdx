## Flutter version compatibility
HMSSDK works with flutter 2.10.x or above.

## Not getting event updates after hot reload/restart
This is caused because the platform channel needs to be reinitialized again, hence this is intended behaviour.
The solution for this is to re-run the app.

Practices for faster development :

* Perform the intended changes.
* Leave the room.
* Perform hot reload/restart and rejoin the room.
* Verify the changes.

The permanent solution for this is in pipeline, we will update once it's done.

## Issues while using `hmssdk_flutter` with flutter 3.0.x
Flutter versions 3.0.0 to 3.0.5 had issues related to Platform View.

Refer: [Android Platform View issue](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/107313) & [Flutter Platform View bug](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/103630)

These were resolved in Flutter versions 3.3.0 & above. Please update the Flutter version to 3.3.0 or above.


## Is there any limit to the number of HMSVideoView on-screen at a time 

`HMSVideoView` internally uses `SurfaceView` in android and `UiKitView` in iOS. It is recommended to render at most 3 to 4 videos on a Single page/screen of the app and rest should be paginated for optimum performance.
