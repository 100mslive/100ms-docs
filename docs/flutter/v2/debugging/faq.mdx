## Not getting event updates after hot reload/restart
This is caused because platform channel needs to be reinitialized again,hence this is intended behaviour.
The solution for this is to re-run the app.

Practices for faster development :

* Perform the intended changes.
* Leave the room.
* Perform hot reload/restart and rejoin the room.
* Verify the changes.

The permanent solution for this is in pipeline, we will update once it's done.

## Issues while using `hmssdk_flutter` with flutter 3.x.x 
Flutter 3.x.x has some issues related to [Platform View](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/107313).
So, it is recommended to use 2.10.x flutter versions with `hmssdk_flutter`. 

## Videos are not getting rendered at the correct position or video screen is coming over the buttons
Please check the flutter version this issue is likely happening due to usage of Flutter 3.x.x series.
This is due to an ongoing issue in Flutter 3.x.x which causes Native Platform Views to be drawn at incorrect position.
Refer: [Android Platform View](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/107313) & [Platform View bug](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/103630)

Use a version of the 2.x.x series, 2.10.5 or lower. We are actively tracking these issues & once they are released on flutter `stable` branch, we'll release a compatible `hmssdk_flutter` version.
