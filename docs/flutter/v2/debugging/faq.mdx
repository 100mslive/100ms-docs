## Videos are not getting rendered at the correct position or video screen is coming over the buttons
Please check the flutter version this issue is likely happening due to usage of Flutter 3.x.x series.
This is due to an ongoing issue in Flutter 3.x.x which causes Native Platform Views to be drawn at incorrect position.
Refer: [Android Platform View](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/107313) & [Platform View bug](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/103630)

Use a version of the 2.x.x series, 2.10.5 or lower. We are actively tracking these issues & once they are released on flutter `stable` branch, we'll release a compatible `hmssdk_flutter` version.
