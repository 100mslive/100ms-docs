title: Camera Controls (Beta)
nav: 7.3

To use the camera controls, we can use `HMSCameraControls` class to access it's functionality.

## Minimum Requirements

-   SDK version 1.5.0 or higher

## Capture at the highest resolution offered by the camera

Takes the highest quality picture from the local video stream in `jpg` format irrespective of publisher's resolution.
It contains `withFlash` parameter which if `true` turns on the flash while capturing image. Default value of `withFlash`
parameter is `false`.

> ðŸ”‘ Note: `captureImageAtMaxSupportedResolution` method only works if camera is turned ON

```dart
//To capture image with `withFlash` as true
//`filePath` can return either the filePath string or an HMSException object in case of error

dynamic filePath = await HMSCameraControls.captureImageAtMaxSupportedResolution(withFlash: true);

if(filePath is HMSException) {
    //Log the error here
    //Handle the error accordingly
}
else{
    //Create image file and use it accordingly
    File imageFile = File(filePath);

    // We can display the image using `Image.file` widget in our applications
    // Image.file(imageFile)
}
```

## Flash

### Check if flash feature is available

Checks if the current facing camera has a flash device.

```dart
dynamic isFlashSupported = await HMSCameraControls.isFlashSupported();

if(isFlashSupported is HMSException) {
    //Log the error here
    //Handle the error accordingly
}
else{
    //Check here whether flash is supported or not
    //isFlashSupported will be a boolean
}
```

### Toggle flash

This method is used to toggle flash, i.e. if its ON it turns it OFF and vice-versa.

```dart
HMSCameraControls.toggleFlash();
```

> ðŸ”‘ Note: If camera is toggled while flash is ON, then flash turns OFF.
