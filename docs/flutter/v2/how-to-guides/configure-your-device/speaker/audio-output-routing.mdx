title: Audio Output Routing
nav: 7.2
---

Audio Output Routing is helpful when users want to switch the audio output to a connected device other than the default one.

For example, you can implement an in-call speaker button that toggles audio output between the speaker, earpiece or any other connected earphones - wired or wireless, etc.

Let's see how we can use hmsSDK to implement this:

<div className="steps-container">

### Fetch Available Audio Devices

Invoke the `getAudioDevicesList` method to fetch the available audio device list. The method returns a list of `HMSAudioDevice` enum.

```dart
List<HMSAudioDevice> availableDevices = await hmsSDK.getAudioDevicesList();


enum HMSAudioDevice {
  SPEAKER_PHONE,
  EARPIECE,
  WIRED_HEADSET, // Android only
  BLUETOOTH, // Android only
  AUTOMATIC, // Android only
  UNKNOWN
}
```

The `getAudioDevicesList` API returns different values based on the Android & iOS platforms. It can return the following `HMSAudioDevice` enum values :

#### - For Android

-   SPEAKER_PHONE - route audio to the device speaker
-   EARPIECE - route audio to earpiece
-   WIRED_HEADSET - route audio to a connected wired device
-   BLUETOOTH - route audio to connected Bluetooth device
-   AUTOMATIC - automatic routing

#### - For iOS

-   SPEAKER_PHONE - route audio to device speaker
-   EARPIECE - route audio earpiece

### Switch Audio Focus to Another Device

Invoke the `switchAudioOutput` method with the appropriate `HMSAudioDevice` value fetched from `getAudioDevicesList` to switch the audio to that device.

The `audioDevice` is a required `HMSAudioDevice` enum type parameter which we discussed above.

```dart
///[audioDevice]: is an enum of type `HMSAudioDevice`
hmsSDK.switchAudioOutput(audioDevice: audioDevice);
```

### Receive the device change updates (Android Only)

Implementing the `onAudioDeviceChanged` listener allows you to get event updates if a new audio device gets connected such as Bluetooth, Wired Headset etc.
This method needs to be overridden in the class where `HMSUpdateListener` is implemented.

Note that this event is available only on the Android platform.

```dart
class Meeting implements HMSUpdateListener, HMSActionResultListener{

  ...

  @override
  void onAudioDeviceChanged(
  {HMSAudioDevice? currentAudioDevice,
  List<HMSAudioDevice>? availableAudioDevice}) {

    // currentAudioDevice : audio device to which audio is curently being routed to
    // availableAudioDevice : all other available audio devices
  }
}
```

</div>

## Get Current Focussed Device (Android Only)

The `getCurrentAudioDevice` method allows you to get the device through which audio output is currently being routed to.

```dart
HMSAudioDevice currentAudioDevice = await hmsSDK.getCurrentAudioDevice();
```

> Note: `onAudioDeviceChanged` listener and `getCurrentAudioDevice` methods are available only on the Android platform.

## Switch Audio Output Device UI (iOS Only)

The `switchAudioOutputUsingiOSUI` allows you to display the native iOS UI for switching the audio output device.
Something similar to this:

<PortraitImage
    src="/docs/docs/v2/flutter-audio-output-routing.png"
    alt="Switch Audio Output"
    height="400"
    width="200"
/>

Let's look at the implementation:

```dart
///[hmsSDK] is the HMSSDK instance
hmsSDK.switchAudioOutputUsingiOSUI();
```
