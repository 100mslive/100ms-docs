<Faq />

## Flutter

### Flutter version compatibility

HMSSDK works with flutter 3.3.x or above.

### Not getting event updates after hot restart

> 🔑 Note: `HMSSDK` supports hot reload if you facing issues in hot reload please check [this](#stopped-getting-callbacks-not-able-to-see-any-peer-after-hot-reload)

This is caused because the platform channel needs to be reinitialized again, hence this is intended behaviour.
The solution for this is to re-run the app.

Practices for faster development :

-   Perform the intended changes.
-   Leave the room.
-   Perform hot reload/restart and rejoin the room.
-   Verify the changes.

The permanent solution for this is in pipeline, we will update once it's done.

### Stopped getting callbacks, not able to see any peer after hot reload

Ensure that the object instantiation is not done while navigating this causes the room state to initialize again

For Eg:

We have `HMSStore` as our data store class then:

❌ Create the instance while navigating this will cause error while hot reloading.

```dart
//This will cause the room state to be empty after hot reload
Navigator.of(context).push(MaterialPageRoute(
                      builder: (_) => ListenableProvider.value(
                            value: HMSStore(),
                            child: VideoCallScreen(),
                          )));
```

✅ Pass `HMSStore` object while navigating, this supports hot reload:

```dart
//This works well even after hot reload
HMSStore dataStore = HMSStore()
Navigator.of(context).push(MaterialPageRoute(
                      builder: (_) => ListenableProvider.value(
                            value: dataStore,
                            child: VideoCallScreen(),
                          )));
```

### Issues while using `hmssdk_flutter` with flutter 3.0.x

Flutter versions 3.0.0 to 3.0.5 had issues related to Platform View.

Refer: [Android Platform View issue](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/107313) & [Flutter Platform View bug](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/103630)

These were resolved in Flutter versions 3.3.0 & above. Please update the Flutter version to 3.3.0 or above.

### Is there any limit to the number of HMSVideoView on-screen at a time

`HMSVideoView` internally uses `SurfaceView` in android and `UiKitView` in iOS. It is recommended to render at most 3 to 4 videos on a Single page/screen of the app and rest should be paginated for optimum performance.

### Do you have any implementation with popular State Management libraries?

Yes, we have multiple Example Apps built using popular State Management libraries.
Please find the implementations below:

-   [Provider](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-flutter/tree/main/example)
-   [Bloc](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-flutter/tree/main/sample%20apps/bloc)
-   [Getx](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-flutter/tree/main/sample%20apps/getx)
-   [Mobx](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-flutter/tree/main/sample%20apps/mobx)
-   [Riverpod](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-flutter/tree/main/sample%20apps/riverpod)

### Not able to get room updates after joining the room

To listen to the room updates please attach `HMSUpdateListener` as:

```dart
class Meeting implements HMSUpdateListener {
    Meeting(){
        hmsSDK.addUpdateListener(listener:updateListener);
    }
    ...
}
```

You can find more details about HMSUpdateListener [here](/flutter/v2/how--to-guides/listen-to-room-updates/update-listeners)

### How to Join Room with Muted Audio/Video?

User can join the room with muted audio/video by default. Please find the docs [here](/flutter/v2/features/join#join-with-muted-audio-video).

### How to get peer updates in Preview?

User can get `onPeerUpdate` in preview the docs can be found [here](/flutter/v2/how--to-guides/set-up-video-conferencing/preview#get-on-peer-update-and-room-state-in-preview)

### How to reduce the join time for HLS peers in large rooms

Since HLS peers don't publish or subscribe any track, only thing required to display the stream is m3u8 URL.
There is a way to reduce the join time for HLS peers especially in large rooms. Checkout the doc [here](/flutter/v2/how--to-guides/record-and-live-stream/hls#how-to-make-the-hls-peers-join-room-faster)

### Getting updates multiple times in the room

Please ensure removing the `HMSUpdateListener` while leaving the room.

```dart
hmsSDK.removeUpdateListener(updateListener);
```

You can find more details about HMSUpdateListener [here](/flutter/v2/how--to-guides/listen-to-room-updates/update-listeners)

### Can I create a room using API?

Yes,please find the link [here](/server-side/v2/Rooms/create-via-api)

### Receiving too many logs from SDK

Logs can be turned OFF using the `hmsLogSettings` parameter of `HMSSDK`. More info about this can be found [here](/flutter/v2/how--to-guides/debugging/error-handling#setting-log-levels-in-sdk)

### Do I need to do anything to handle poor internet connection?

Not much, just turn on a flag in dashboard, and show a proper UI when a video gets degraded/unsubscribed. More details [here](/flutter/v2/how--to-guides/set-up-video-conferencing/render-video/auto-video-degrade-restore).

### Getting Jitpack error: Could not find WebRTC-m104-hms-1.3.aar


This occurs intermittently when Jitpack gets down, to fix this permanently you can update the HMSSDK to latest version. In case you can't update
the HMSSDK version then please wait till Jitpack is up again.

> 🔑 Note: This doesn't affect the builds already in production. It will work as usual, only if you are currently building the application
> then you might face this.

### How do I implement Raise Hand, Polls in application?

You can do using [peer metadata](/flutter/v2/how--to-guides/interact-with-room/peer/peer-metadata-update#use-cases).

### Why do I see videos getting stuck or frozen?

If you have enabled subscribe degradation from the dashboard, the SDK might go in the degradation mode on poor internet connection turning off some videos to ensure good call quality. When this is done, a flag on the track will be turned on to let the UI know. The UI should treat it similar to the track turning off for purpose of displaying avatar etc. More details [here](/flutter/v2/how--to-guides/set-up-video-conferencing/render-video/auto-video-degrade-restore).

### Why is my device heating up while using 100ms SDK?

Since 100ms SDKs download live audio & videos there are chances that with incorrect API usage some devices can face heating up or quick battery drainage issues.
When faced with such issues, ensure that -

-   Limited number of videos are getting downloaded. Ensure that the videos which are on-screen are only consuming bandwidth.

-   Videos which are not visible on screen should not be downloaded. It is recommended to render at most 3 to 4 videos on a Single page/screen of the app and rest should be paginated for optimum performance.

-   Ensure that the application does not download videos while it's in background. Check out our docs on background handling [here](/flutter/v2/how--to-guides/set-up-video-conferencing/background-handling)

-   Check how often the application state gets updated. Avoid unnecessary rebuilds as this causes the `HMSVideoView` to detach and attach again.

-   It is suggested to keep the video-conferencing or streaming state management that is HMSSDK separate from application state management, this will help in avoiding rebuilds while in call.

-   Ensure the HMSSDK state is properly disposed after leaving the call. Checkout the best practices [here](/flutter/v2/how--to-guides/set-up-video-conferencing/leave)

-   Heating issue might be more prominent in `Debug` builds rather than `Release` ones due to active development.

### How to mirror screen while debugging the application?

To mirror your device you can use tools like [SCRCPY](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy#get-the-app), [VYSOR](https://www.vysor.io/download/), QuickTime Player etc.

### What is the maximum allowed duration for a session?

The maximum allowed duration for a session on the 100ms platform is 12 hours.

### When a participant puts the Flutter iOS app in Background and enables PiP, why does the other participant loses the Remote Camera Video Track?

When your app enters PIP mode, it needs [com.apple.developer.avfoundation.multitasking-camera-access](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_developer_avfoundation_multitasking-camera-access) entitlement to continue using the camera. Without the entitlement, the system disables the camera access for your app. When your app enters PIP mode, it needs this entitlement to continue using the camera. Without the Entitlement approval from Apple, your app won't be able capture camera feed in Background.

### When running the 100ms Flutter iOS Example app, why am I getting the error "No profile for team 'XXXXXXXXXX' matching 'FlutterBroadcastUploadExtension' found"?

The "No profile for team 'XXXXXXXXXX' matching 'FlutterBroadcastUploadExtension' found" error occurs when building the fully featured 100ms Flutter iOS Example app. This error is related to the Target Name used in the app, which is called `FlutterBroadcastUploadExtension`. This Target is required to start Screen Sharing from iOS Devices.

To resolve this error, follow these steps:

1. Delete the `FlutterBroadcastUploadExtension` target to quickly test the app. This will remove the screen sharing feature from the app.
2. If you want to enable screen sharing from iOS devices, set it up correctly by following the steps [iOS screen sharing setup guide](https://www.100ms.live/docs/flutter/v2/how--to-guides/set-up-video-conferencing/screen-share#ios-setup).
3. Make sure to configure the screen sharing properly by following the instructions in the guide.
4. Once the screen sharing setup is complete, try building the app again. The error should no longer occur.

### How can I check whether to display mic or camera mute/unmute button based on role permission

To display mic or camera mute/unmute button based on role publish permissions checkout the doc [here](https://www.100ms.live/docs/flutter/v2/how--to-guides/set-up-video-conferencing/mute#when-to-show-miccamera-buttons-on-ui)

### I am not getting `onMessage` callback after sending messages

The `onMessage` callback is not triggered for messages sent by the local peer. In other words, if you send a message yourself, you will not receive the `onMessage` callback for that particular message.
If you are not receiving the callback for remote messages as well, please check the docs [here](https://www.100ms.live/docs/flutter/v2/how-to-guides/set-up-video-conferencing/chat)
To ensure that the message sent by the local peer is included in your messages list, you will need to store it manually. You can achieve this by handling the `onSuccess` callback of the `HMSActionResultListener` and adding the message to your messages list, as shown in the example [here](https://www.100ms.live/docs/flutter/v2/how-to-guides/set-up-video-conferencing/chat#sending-chat-messages) 

### I want to suggest a new feature.
