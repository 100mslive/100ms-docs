The `HMSHLSPlayer` is an HLS player offered by 100ms that can be used to play HLS streams. The player takes a URL to play the stream. It also provides the ability to send analytics events related to the HLS playback to the 100ms dashboard.

## How to add HLS Player to your application

You can add the `HMSHLSPlayer` just like some other widget. It has three parameters:

- hlsUrl: m3u8 HLS Stream URL, this is an optional field if not passed SDK gets this from `onJoin` or `onRoomUpdate` callback

- isHLSStatsRequired: If HLS stats are required set this to true. Default is false

- showPlayerControls: To show the default player UI set this to true. Default is false

Let's check how you can Add `HMSHLSPlayer` to your widget tree:

```dart

///This returns the basic HMSHLSPlayer with stats and player controls disabled.
Widget HLSPlayer(){
    return HMSHLSPlayer();
}
```

To get a player with default OS player controls and stats enabled:

```dart
Widget HLSPlayer(){
    return HMSHLSPlayer(
        showPlayerControls: true,
        isHLSStatsRequired: true
    );
}
```

## HLS Player controls

HMSSDK exposes `HMSHLSPlayerController` to control the HLS Player. We can have our own custom UI over HLS Player and use 
this controller to control the player.

### How to start/stop the playback

- **Start**

To start the HLS Player we can use the `start` method. This takes an optional `hlsUrl` String which is HLS m3u8 stream URL.

> ðŸ”‘ Note: If `hlsUrl` is not passed then the HMSSDK tries to get the stream URL internally.

```dart
HMSHLSPlayerController.start();
```

- **Stop**

To stop HLS Player we can use the `stop` method.

> ðŸ”‘ Note: There is no need to call `stop` explicitly. The SDK automatically calls `stop` as soon as the `HMSHLSPlayer` is unmounted 
>          from the screen.

```dart
HMSHLSPlayerController.stop();
```

### How to Pause and Resume the Playback

- **Pause**

To pause the HLS stream we can use the `pause` method

```dart
HMSHLSPlayerController.pause();
```

- **Resume**

To resume the paused stream we can use the `resume` method

```dart
HMSHLSPlayerController.resume();
```

### How to Seek to Live Position

To seek to the live position we can use the `seekToLivePosition` method

```dart
HMSHLSPlayerController.seekToLivePosition();
```

### How to Seek Forward or Backward

- **seekForward**

To seek forward we can use the `seekForward` method

```dart
HMSHLSPlayerController.seekForward(seconds:"Time in seconds you wish to seek forward");
```

- **seekBackward**

To seek backward we can use the `seekBackward` method

```dart
HMSHLSPlayerController.seekBackward(seconds:"Time in seconds you wish to seek backward");
```

### How to Change Volume of HLS Playback

To set volume for HLS Playback we can use the `setVolume` method

```dart
HMSHLSPlayerController.seekBackward(volume:"Volume between 0 to 100");
```

> Note: `volume` can only take values from 0 to 100.

### How to get HLS Callbacks

HMSSDK exposes `HMSHLSPlaybackEventsListener` to get the callbacks related to HLS Playback.

Let's see how we can use this in our application 

<div className="steps-container">

### Implement HMSHLSPlaybackEventsListener

```dart
class Meeting implements HMSHLSPlaybackEventsListener{}
```

This will show error since we will need to implement the HMSHLSPlaybackEventsListener

### Override the HMSHLSPlaybackEventsListener methods:

```dart
class Meeting implements HMSHLSPlaybackEventsListener{

  ...
  
  ///override the methods related to HMSHLSPlaybackEventsListener

  ///Callback to know about any HLS Timed Metadata cue and use it's data to show any UI like quizzes, poll etc. to HLS viewers.
  @override
  void onCue({required HMSHLSCue hlsCue}) {
    ///Handle the hlsCue object as per your UI
  }

  ///Callback to know about the errors that happen during playback.
  @override
  void onPlaybackFailure({required String? error}) {
    /// Handle the error here
  }

  ///Callback to know about the state change event during the playback.
  @override
  void onPlaybackStateChanged({required HMSHLSPlaybackState playbackState}) {
    /// This is used to update the UI based on the playback state like
    /// showing loaders in case of BUFFERING.
  }

  /// These two methods are related to HLS Stats and will only get called if HLS Stats is enabled

  ///Callback to know about failures in HLS Stats.
  @override
  void onHLSError({required HMSException hlsException}) {
    /// Handle the stats error here
  }

  /// Callback to get HLS Player stats
  @override
  void onHLSEventUpdate({required HMSHLSPlayerStats playerStats}) {
    /// Render the HLS Player stats here.
  }


  ...

}
```
</div>

Let us understand the `HMSHLSCue` class:

```dart
class HMSHLSCue {
  // Unique id of the timed event
  final String? id;

  // startDate of the timed event
  final DateTime startDate;

  // endDate of the timed event
  final DateTime? endDate;

  // String payload of the timed event
  final String? payload;
}
```

- **id**: Unique String containing the `Id` of the event

- **startDate**: DateTime object containing the startDate of the event

- **endDate**: DateTime object containing the endDate of the event

- **payload**: String payload received from other peers.

> ðŸ”‘ Note: The difference between `endDate` and `startDate` can be used to get the duration for which the payload is valid.


### How to Know the Stats Related to HLS Playback

To get the stats for HLS Player `HMSHLSPlayerController` provides a method to attach and detach the stats listener similar to other listeners like HMSUpdateListener, HMSKeyChangeListener etc.

- **Attach a listener**

To start getting HLS Stats  we need to call the `addHLSStatsListener` method

```dart
HMSHLSPlayerController.addHLSStatsListener();
```

- **Detach a listener**

To stop getting HLS Stats we need to call the `removeHLSStatsListener` method

```dart
HMSHLSPlayerController.removeHLSStatsListener();
```

### How to send HLS Timed Metadata

To send HLS Timed Metadata, HMSSDK exposes `sendHLSTimedMetadata` method which takes in a list of `HMSHLSTimedMetadata` objects.

Let us first understand the `HMSHLSTimedMetadata` class:

```dart
class HMSHLSTimedMetadata {
  ///metadata contains the message/data which can be sent to a HLS Stream
  final String metadata;

  ///duration is the time interval for which the metadata is valid
  final int duration;
}
```

- **metadata**: Metadata is the message or payload that needs to be sent as HLS Stream

- **duration**: It is the time duration for which the metadata is valid. Duration is 1 second by default.

Now let us see how we can send timed metadata:

```dart
class Meeting implements HMSUpdateListener, HMSActionResultListener,HMSHLSPlaybackEventsListener{

    ...

    /// We create a list of metadata to be sent
    List<HMSHLSTimedMetadata> hlsMetadata = [

        /// Metadata for 1 second
        HMSHLSTimedMetadata(
            metadata: "Hey from 100ms for 1 seconds"),

        /// Metadata for 10 seconds
        HMSHLSTimedMetadata(metadata: "Hey from 100ms for 10 seconds",duration: 10)
    ];

    ///Here [hmsSDK] is the HMSSDK instance used to join the room

    /// metadata is a list of HMSHLSTimedMetadata objects 
    /// since we can send multiple messages at the same time.
    /// [hmsActionResultListener] is an instance of class implementing HMSActionResultListener
    /// this is the instance of class which implements HMSActionResultListener

    void sendHLSTimedMetadata() {
        hmsSDK.sendHLSTimedMetadata(metadata: hlsMetadata, hmsActionResultListener: this);
    }

    ...
}
```

Let's understand the HLS Timed metadata flow with the help of a diagram:
