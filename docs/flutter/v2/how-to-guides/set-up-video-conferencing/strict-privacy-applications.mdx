title: Strict Privacy Applications
nav: 4.9

Strict Privacy Applications are those applications which ask for permissions as & when required thus following something
similar to principle of least privilege.

## Steps to create a strict privacy application:

<div className="steps-container">

### Join in a role without video permissions.

Create three roles with permissions as:

-   Host

![host](/docs/v2/flutter-host.png)

-   Guest

![guest](/docs/v2/flutter-guest.png)

-   Viewer

![viewer](/docs/v2/flutter-viewer.png)

> These roles are just for examples. User can create their own roles based on use cases.

### If role of user is changed to a role which has audio-video publishing permission then ask for permissions as:

```dart
class Meeting  implements HMSUpdateListener, HMSActionResultListener{

    ...
    @override
    void onRoleChangeRequest({required HMSRoleChangeRequest roleChangeRequest}) {
        if(roleChangeRequest.suggestedRole.publishSettings?.allowed.contains("video")??false){
            //if video permissions are not available
            await Permission.camera.request();
        }
        if(roleChangeRequest.suggestedRole.publishSettings?.allowed.contains("audio")??false){
            //if audio permissions are not available
            await Permission.microphone.request();
            //if bluetooth permissions are not available
            await Permission.bluetoothConnect.request();
        }

        //if the application have required permissions
        hmsSDK.acceptChangeRole(roleChangeRequest);
    }
}
```

</div>

> This is applicable only when user asks for permission while changing role. In case of force role change
> the application is required to have permissions before the role change.
