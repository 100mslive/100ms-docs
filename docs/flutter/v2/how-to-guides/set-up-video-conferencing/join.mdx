## Overview

To join and interact with others in audio or video call, the user needs to join a `room`.

When a user indicates that they want to _join_ the room, your app should have -

1. User Name - The name which should be displayed to other peers in the room.
2. [Auth Token](/flutter/v2/get-started/token) - The Client side Authentication Token generated by the Token Service.

You can also optionally pass these fields -

1. Track Settings - Such as joining a Room with Muted Audio or Video using the `HMSTrackSetting` object. More information available [here](#join-with-muted-audio-video)

2. User Metadata - This can be used to pass any additional metadata associated with the user using `metadata` of [HMSConfig object](https://pub.dev/documentation/hmssdk_flutter/latest/hmssdk_flutter/HMSConfig-class.html). For Eg: user-id mapping at the application side. More information is available [here](/flutter/v2/how--to-guides/interact-with-room/peer/peer-metadata-update).

## Join a Room

This section will take you through a sample code to join a room and receive room updates:

```dart
class Meeting implements HMSUpdateListener{

    late HMSSDK hmsSDK;

    Meeting() {
        initHMSSDK();
    }

    void initHMSSDK() async {
        hmsSDK = HMSSDK();
        await hmsSDK.build(); // ensure to await while invoking the `build` method
        hmsSDK.addUpdateListener(listener: this);
        HMSConfig config = HMSConfig(authToken: 'eyJH5c', // client-side token generated from your token service
                                userName: 'John Appleseed');
        hmsSDK.join(config: config);
    }


    @override
    void onJoin({required HMSRoom room}) async {
       /// The User has joined the Room successfully. Among other operations, you can now start rendering Videos now: https://www.100ms.live/docs/flutter/v2/how-to-guides/set-up-video-conferencing/render-video/overview
    }

    @override
    void onRoomUpdate(
        {required HMSRoom room,
        required HMSRoomUpdate update}) {
            /// Room updates: https://www.100ms.live/docs/flutter/v2/features/update-listener-enums#hms-room-update
    }

    @override
    void onPeerUpdate(
        {required HMSPeer peer,
        required HMSPeerUpdate update}) async {
            /// Peer updates: https://www.100ms.live/docs/flutter/v2/features/update-listener-enums#hms-peer-update
    }

    @override
    void onTrackUpdate(
        {required HMSTrack track,
        required HMSTrackUpdate trackUpdate,
        required HMSPeer peer}) {
            /// Track updates: https://www.100ms.live/docs/flutter/v2/features/update-listener-enums#hms-track-update
    }

    @override
    void onHMSError(
        {required HMSException error}) {
            /// Error updates: https://www.100ms.live/docs/flutter/v2/features/error-handling#hms-exception
    }


    @override
    void onMessage(
        {required HMSMessage message}) {
            /// Message updates: https://www.100ms.live/docs/flutter/v2/features/chat#receiving-chat-messages
    }

    @override
    void onRoleChangeRequest(
        {required HMSRoleChangeRequest roleChangeRequest}) {
            /// Role Change Request: https://www.100ms.live/docs/flutter/v2/features/change-role#accept-role-change-request
    }

    @override
    void onUpdateSpeakers(
        {required List<HMSSpeaker> updateSpeakers}) {
            /// This is triggered every second with a list of speakers who are currently speaking.
    }

    @override
    void onReconnecting() {
        /// Reconnection callback: https://www.100ms.live/docs/flutter/v2/features/reconnection-handling#reconnecting-and-reconnected-callbacks
    }

    @override
    void onReconnected() {
        /// Reconnection callback: https://www.100ms.live/docs/flutter/v2/features/reconnection-handling#reconnecting-and-reconnected-callbacks
    }

    @override
    void onChangeTrackStateRequest(
        {required HMSTrackChangeRequest hmsTrackChangeRequest}) {
            /// Getting mute-unmute callback: https://www.100ms.live/docs/flutter/v2/features/remote-mute-unmute#handling-an-unmute-callback
    }

    @override
    void onRemovedFromRoom(
        {required HMSPeerRemovedFromPeer hmsPeerRemovedFromPeer}) {
            /// Handle peer removal case: https://www.100ms.live/docs/flutter/v2/features/remove-peer#handling-the-remove-peer-callback
    }

    @override
    void onAudioDeviceChanged(
        {HMSAudioDevice? currentAudioDevice,
        List<HMSAudioDevice>? availableAudioDevice}) {
            /// Get notified when the audio device is changed: https://www.100ms.live/docs/flutter/v2/features/audio-output-routing#adding-audio-device-change-event-listener-android-only
    }

    @override
    void onSessionStoreAvailable(
        {HMSSessionStore? hmsSessionStore}) {
            /// Get notified when the Session Store is available for usage. Read more about Session Store here: https://www.100ms.live/docs/flutter/v2/how-to-guides/interact-with-room/room/session-store
    }
}
```

### Step-by-step guide

This section will take you through the join journey step by step :

<div className="steps-container">

### Create a class implementing HMSUpdateListener

Let's create a class that implements `HMSUpdateListener` and acts as a data source for our UI

```dart
class Meeting implements HMSUpdateListener{}
```

### Create HMSSDK instance

Now, create an instance of `HMSSDK` using the `build` method. The `build` should always be called with `await` to ensure correct initialization & setup of the 100ms SDK.

```dart
HMSSDK hmsSDK = HMSSDK();
await hmsSDK.build(); // ensure to await while invoking the `build` method
```

### Attach HMSUpdateListener

The methods of `HMSUpdateListener` are invoked to notify updates happening in the room like as soon as `join` is successful we get `onJoin` callback.
So, to get these updates we need to attach the listener as:

```dart
//`this` value corresponds to the instance implementing HMSUpdateListener
hmsSDK.addUpdateListener(listener: this);
```

### Create HMSConfig object

Next, create an object of [HMSConfig class](https://pub.dev/documentation/hmssdk_flutter/latest/hmssdk_flutter/HMSConfig-class.html) using the available join configurations.

```dart
HMSConfig config = HMSConfig(authToken: 'eyJH5c', // client-side token generated from your token service
                            userName: 'John Appleseed');
```

### Invoke Join

Now, we are primed to join the room. All you have to do is call `join` by passing the `config` object.

```dart
hmsSDK.join(config: config);
```

</div>

The methods of `HMSUpdateListener` are invoked to notify updates happening in the room like a peer joins/leaves, a track mute/unmute, etc.

After calling `join` your app will be provided an update from the 100ms SDK.

‚úÖ If successful, the `onJoin({required HMSRoom room})` method of `HMSUpdateListener` will be invoked with information about the room encapsulated in the `HMSRoom` object.

‚ùå If failure, the `onHMSError({required HMSException error})` method will be invoked with exact failure reason.

Once you get `onJoin` callback you have joined a room successfully ü•≥

## Join with Muted Audio / Video

Joining with Muted Audio / Video is a customization that sets the microphone and camera state before joining the room.

By default `HMSSDK` keeps the microphone and camera ON but by using this feature you can decide their state according to your use case.

This can be achieved using the `hmsVideoTrackInitState` property for Video and `hmsAudioTrackInitState` for Audio in the `hmsTrackSetting` parameter
of the `HMSSDK` constructor.

Here `trackInitialState` property of `HMSVideoTrackSetting` and `HMSAudioTrackSetting` is an Enum of type `HMSTrackInitState` which has the possible values as:

```dart
enum HMSTrackInitState {

    /// If the track needs to be kept mute while joining
    MUTED,

    /// If the track needs to be kept unmute while joining
    UNMUTED,
}
```

Let's see how this can be achieved in the following steps.

1. First, for joining a room with muted audio/video, these values need to be set in the `hmsTrackSetting` property as -

```dart
HMSTrackSetting trackSettings = HMSTrackSetting(
        /// This is for joining with muted audio(mic off) and muted video(camera off)
        audioTrackSetting: HMSAudioTrackSetting(trackInitialState: HMSTrackInitState.MUTED),
        videoTrackSetting: HMSVideoTrackSetting(trackInitialState: HMSTrackInitState.MUTED));
```

2. Now, create the `HMSSDK` object by passing the `HMSTrackSetting` object created above :

```dart
class Meeting implements HMSUpdateListener{

    late HMSSDK hmsSDK;
    Meeting(){
        // pass the trackSettings while constructing the HMSSDK instance
         Ã∂hÃ∂mÃ∂sÃ∂SÃ∂DÃ∂KÃ∂ Ã∂=Ã∂ Ã∂HÃ∂MÃ∂SÃ∂SÃ∂DÃ∂KÃ∂(Ã∂)Ã∂;Ã∂
        HMSSDK hmsSDK = HMSSDK(hmsTrackSetting: trackSettings);
        setupHMSSDK();
    }

    void setupHMSSDK() async{
        await hmsSDK.build(); // ensure to await while invoking the `build` method
        hmsSDK.addUpdateListener(listener: this);
        HMSConfig config = HMSConfig(authToken: 'eyJH5c', // client-side token generated from your token service
                                    userName: 'John Appleseed');
        hmsSDK.join(config: config);
    }
}
```

Rest all the steps are same as above.

Now, the user joins the room with the microphone and the camera turned off.
