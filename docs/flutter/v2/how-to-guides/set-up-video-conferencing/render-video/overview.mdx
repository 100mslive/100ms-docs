It all comes down to this. All the setup so far has been done so that we can show live-streaming videos in our beautiful app.

100ms Flutter Package provides the `HMSVideoView` widget that renders the video on the screen.

We simply have to pass a Video Track object to the `HMSVideoView` to begin automatic rendering of Live Video Stream.

We can also optionally pass props like `key`, `scaleType`, `mirror` or `matchParent` to customize the `HMSVideoView` widget.

```dart
HMSVideoView(
  track: videoTrack,
  key: Key(videoTrack.trackId),
),
```

## How to get HMSVideoTrack

This section contains info about how to get video tracks so that we can display them on screen.

`HMSVideoTrack` is used to render video in HMSVideoView. Single `HMSVideoView` can be attached to only one `HMSVideoTrack`.

> For resetting the track or updating any property in `HMSVideoView` it is required to use the new HMSVideoView widget.

To get tracks we will be listening to HMSUpdateListener's `onTrackUpdate`.

`onTrackUpdate` provides updates for both Audio & Video tracks so to segregate them we can put a check like below:

```dart
/// check if the track is video or audio

/// For Audio
track.kind == HMSTrackKind.kHMSTrackKindAudio

/// For Video
track.kind == HMSTrackKind.kHMSTrackKindVideo
```

Let's see an example of how we can extract the video tracks from `onTrackUpdate`:

```dart
class Meeting implements HMSUpdateListener{

  late HMSSDK hmsSDK;
  ...

  void onTrackUpdate(
      {required HMSTrack track,
      required HMSTrackUpdate trackUpdate,
      required HMSPeer peer}) {

        if (track.kind == HMSTrackKind.kHMSTrackKindVideo) {
          //We will get all the video tracks
          if(track.source == "REGULAR"){
            //We will get only camera feed(Normal Video) tracks of peer here
            if(peer.isLocal){
              //We will get the local peer video track here
            }
            else{
              //We will get the remote peer video tracks here
            }
          }
          else{
            //To get screenshare or other video tracks from peers
            //For screenshare
            if(track.source == "SCREEN"){
              //We will get screen share track here
            }
          }
        }
      }
}
```

Now, once we have the video tracks we can pass the video track to `HMSVideoView` to get live video on the screen.
Screenshare as well as normal video tracks can be rendered in the same way which we will see below.

> `HMSSDK` automatically handles audio tracks. So they are not required to be handled in the application. Although [mute/unmute](/flutter/v2/how--to-guides/set-up-video-conferencing/mute) or [set audio volume](/flutter/v2/how--to-guides/interact-with-room/track/set-volume) features are provided
> by SDK.

## Render Video

This section contains information about how we can render the video once we have the track.

To display video tracks `HMSSDK` provides the `HMSVideoView` widget.
We just need to pass the `track` which is `HMSVideoTrack` instance to get our video running as:

```dart
//videoTrack is an instance of HMSVideoTrack
HMSVideoView(track: videoTrack);
```

## Configuring video view

`HMSVideoView` has several properties to configure the way video is rendered as:

### 1. matchParent (Deprecated)

This is a `bool` type parameter, `true` indicates that `HMSVideoView` can take the size of parent widget. It will have no impact on the functionality or behavior of the `HMSVideoView` component.
In upcoming versions of the HMSSDK, this deprecated property will be completely removed.

### 2. scaleType

The `ScaleType` property decides how much space the video will take from the available space.
`ScaleType` is an enum with values:

```dart
enum ScaleType {

  //Video maintains the aspect ratio so it only occupies space based on the aspect ratio
  SCALE_ASPECT_FIT,

  //Video occupies all the available space and may get cropped
  SCALE_ASPECT_FILL,

  //Video aspect ratio is balanced similar to SCALE_ASPECT_FIT
  SCALE_ASPECT_BALANCED
}
```

> ðŸ”‘ Note: `SCALE_ASPECT_FIT` is the default `scaleType` for HMSVideoView

`SCALE_ASPECT_FILL` might crop the video if the parent widget is small. So, for cases like screen share where cropping is not acceptable
use the default type i.e `SCALE_ASPECT_FIT`.

### 3. setMirror

This is a `bool` type parameter, `true` indicates that the video feed gets mirrored and `false` shows the track as it is.
Generally true for local peer and false for a remote peers

### 4. disableAutoSimulcastLayerSelect

HMSVideoView has an automatic simulcast layer selection capability which is enabled if adaptive bitrate is enabled. You can check more about it [here](/concepts/v2/concepts/adaptive-bitrate).

It will select a layer that best matches the current view frame size and reacts to frame updates. In case manual layer selection is preferred set `disableAutoSimulcastLayerSelect` property to `true`. By default, the track layer is set to `high`.

> Always pass the `Key` parameter to `HMSVideoView` with the unique Video Track's `trackId` value so that it can be disposed of and reset correctly during rebuilds.

## Capture Snapshot

You can capture a snapshot of the video stream of a local or remote peer's video. To capture a snapshot, you call captureSnapshot method on HMSVideoTrack instance to get a Uint8List containing a snapshot of the video stream. Know more about captureSnapshot [here](/flutter/v2/how--to-guides/capture-frame/capture-snapshot).

```dart
  HMSVideoTrack videoTrack;
  ...

  //Capture snapshot
  Uint8List? bytes = await videoTrack.captureSnapshot();
```

## Best Practices

### Dispose HMSVideoView to conserve bandwidth and cleanup elements

Remove the HMSVideoView from UI and it will not render its video & conserve network bandwidth.

It is always advised to stop rendering video when it is not required to save bandwidth consumption.
This is done in the example app by setting the `isOffscreen` property of `PeerTrackNode` as true when the peer tile is off-screen. So that app does not download the video track when the tile is off-screen.

### Limit the number of HMSVideoView on-screen at a time

`HMSVideoView` internally uses `SurfaceView` in android and `UiKitView` in iOS. It is recommended to render at most 4-6 videos at a time on-screen and
rest should be paginated for better performance.

Check out our fully featured [Example app here](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-flutter/tree/main/example).

### Display Screen Share Tracks without getting cropped from edges

A peer in Room can broadcast their Screen from any platform like Web, Android, iOS, etc. If a peer shares their Screen from Web & the viewer is on a Mobile platform, some content on the Screen can get cropped. It's necessary to configure the `HMSVideoView` correctly to ensure the complete Screen share content is visible without any clipping/cropping from edges.

Always create the `HMSVideoView` with `ScaleType` as `ScaleType.SCALE_ASPECT_FIT` for correctly showing Screenshare Tracks.

Let's look at the implementation:

```dart
 HMSVideoView(
  track: screenShareTrack,  // pass the screen share track here
  scaleType: ScaleType.SCALE_ASPECT_FIT, // always set to Aspect Fit for Screenshare Tracks
  key: Key(videoTrack.trackId),   // set a unique identifier using the trackId
)
```

## HMSVideoView Widget

The 100ms Video View Widget named `HMSVideoView` is built over the Stateless Widget.
This `HMSVideoView` widget and all of its available properties are listed below.

```dart
class HMSVideoView extends StatelessWidget {

  /// This will render video with trackId present in the track
  /// [track] - the video track to be displayed
  final HMSVideoTrack track;

  // [matchParent] - to match the size of the parent widget
  ///@Deprecated("matchParent is not longer necessary and will be removed in future version")
  final bool matchParent;

  // [scaleType] - To set the video scaling
  final ScaleType scaleType;

  // [setMirror] - To set mirroring of video
  final bool setMirror;

  // [disableAutoSimulcastLayerSelect] - To disable auto simulcast (Adaptive Bitrate)
  final bool disableAutoSimulcastLayerSelect;
}
```
