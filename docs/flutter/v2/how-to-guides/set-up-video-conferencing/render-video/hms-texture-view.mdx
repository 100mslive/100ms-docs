HMSTextureView is an alternative and recommended way that can be used to display video streams. Flutter frameworks has a performance issue while using
SurfaceView in android devices. Check the issue [here](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/118384).

To display we can simply pass a video track object to `HMSTextureView` widget.

```dart
///videoTrack is an instance of [HMSVideoTrack]
HMSTextureView(
  track: videoTrack,
)
```

### Configuring HMSTextureView

`HMSTextureView` with default parameters is perfectly optimized for most of the use cases, still for customizing it you can pass the following parameters:

### 1. scaleType

To set the video scaling type. Default is `SCALE_ASPECT_FIT`

![Scale Type](/docs/v2/flutter-scale-type.png)

### 2. setMirror

To mirror the video. Default is `false`. For local video tracks, it is recommended to set it to `true`

### 3. disableAutoSimulcastLayerSelect

To disable auto simulcast (Adaptive Bitrate). Default is `false` i.e. auto simulcast is enabled by default.
Checkout the [adaptive bitrate](/flutter/v2/how--to-guides/set-up-video-conferencing/render-video/adaptive-bitrate) guide for more info.

### 4. controller

To control the video view, this is useful for custom usecases when you wish to control the `addTrack` and `removeTrack`
track functionalities on your own. Default value is `null`. `controller` can be initialized as:

```dart
///Initialising controller without track
HMSTextureViewController(addTrackByDefault: false);
```

`HMSTextureViewController` contains following parameters:

- `track` : To set the track to be added by default. Default value is `null`.

- `addTrackByDefault` : To call `addTrack` by default as HMSTextureViewController object is created. If `addTrackByDefault` is set as true, track parameter also needs to be set. Default value is `true`.

- `disableAutoSimulcastLayerSelect`: To disable auto simulcast (Adaptive Bitrate). Default is `false` i.e. auto simulcast is enabled by default.
Checkout the [adaptive bitrate](/flutter/v2/how--to-guides/set-up-video-conferencing/render-video/adaptive-bitrate) guide for more info.

How 100ms uses `HMSTextureViewController` in its prebuilt, check it out [here](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-flutter/blob/main/packages/hms_room_kit/lib/src/meeting/meeting_store.dart)

### 5. addTrackByDefault

To call `addTrack` by default as HMSTextureView is attached to the tree. Default value is `true`. If you are passing this as well ensure that you have the instance of `HMSTextureViewController` as well.

## How to get HMSVideoTrack

This section contains info about how to get video tracks so that we can display them on screen.

`HMSVideoTrack` is used to render video in HMSVideoView. Single `HMSTextureView` can be attached to only one `HMSVideoTrack`.

> For resetting the track just call `addTrack` method on the `HMSTextureViewController` with new track.

To get tracks we will be listening to HMSUpdateListener's `onTrackUpdate`.

`onTrackUpdate` provides updates for both Audio & Video tracks so to segregate them we can put a check like below:

```dart
/// check if the track is video or audio

/// For Audio
track.kind == HMSTrackKind.kHMSTrackKindAudio

/// For Video
track.kind == HMSTrackKind.kHMSTrackKindVideo
```

Let's see an example of how we can extract the video tracks from `onTrackUpdate`:

```dart
class Meeting implements HMSUpdateListener{

  late HMSSDK hmsSDK;
  ...

  void onTrackUpdate(
      {required HMSTrack track,
      required HMSTrackUpdate trackUpdate,
      required HMSPeer peer}) {

        if (track.kind == HMSTrackKind.kHMSTrackKindVideo) {
          //We will get all the video tracks
          if(track.source == "REGULAR"){
            //We will get only camera feed(Normal Video) tracks of peer here
            if(peer.isLocal){
              //We will get the local peer video track here
            }
            else{
              //We will get the remote peer video tracks here
            }
          }
          else{
            //To get screenshare or other video tracks from peers
            //For screenshare
            if(track.source == "SCREEN"){
              //We will get screen share track here
            }
          }
        }
      }
}
```

Now, once we have the video tracks we can pass the video track to `HMSTextureView` to get live video on the screen.
Screenshare as well as normal video tracks can be rendered in the same way which we will see below.

> `HMSSDK` automatically handles audio tracks. So they are not required to be handled in the application. Although [mute/unmute](/flutter/v2/how--to-guides/set-up-video-conferencing/mute) or [set audio volume](/flutter/v2/how--to-guides/interact-with-room/track/set-volume) features are provided
> by SDK.

## Render Video

This section contains information about how we can render the video once we have the track.

To display video tracks `HMSSDK` provides the `HMSTextureView` widget.
We just need to pass the `track` which is `HMSVideoTrack` instance to get our video running as:

```dart
//videoTrack is an instance of HMSVideoTrack
HMSTextureView(track: videoTrack);
```
