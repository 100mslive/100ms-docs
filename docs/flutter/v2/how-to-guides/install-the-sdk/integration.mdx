## Installing 100ms package

[![Pub Version](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/hmssdk_flutter)](https://pub.dev/packages/hmssdk_flutter)

Add the `hmssdk_flutter` plugin in dependencies of pubspec.yaml

```dart
#pubspec.yaml

dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

  hmssdk_flutter:
```

> HMSSDK is supported with flutter 3.3.x or above versions.

> There are 2 ways of adding plugin in pubspec.yaml file with and without version locking.
> Without version locking flutter will fetch the latest compatible package with your project.
> Lock version will load the specific version written in pubspec.yaml file.

## Setting up the library

Run following in command in terminal.

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## Update Version

2 ways of upgrade version

1. Find the latest version of `hmssdk_flutter` at [here](https://pub.dev/packages/hmssdk_flutter) and update pubspec.yaml file.
2. Using the following command in terminal:

```bash
flutter pub upgrade
```

> Users of iOS devices running Flutter versions 3.10.xx or earlier might experience crashes due to a known issue reported on GitHub [link](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/127489).

## Device Permissions

### Android

Camera, Recording Audio and Internet permissions are required. Add them to your AndroidManifest.xml.

```xml
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera"/>

<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera.autofocus"/>

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA"/>

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE"/>

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS"/>

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"/>

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"/>

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" android:maxSdkVersion="30" />

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT" />
```

### Update target Android version

Update the Android SDK version to 21 or later by navigating to the directory and updating the android/app/build.gradle file

```xml
defaultConfig{
  minSdkVersion 21
  â€¦
}
```

### iOS

Add the entitlements for video, audio and network access to your Info.plist

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow access to Camera to enable video calling.</string>
<key>NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow access to Camera to network to enable video calling.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Allow access to Camera to mic to enable video calling.</string>
```

### Update target iOS version

Update the iOS version to 12 or later by navigating to the directory and updating the ios/Podfile file.

```
platform :ios, '12.0'
```

### Flutter

You will need to request Camera and Record Audio permissions at runtime before you join a call or display a preview as follows:

1. Add `permission_handler` plugin in pubspec.yaml file under dependencies.

```yaml
permission_handler:
```

2. Before navigating to the preview or meeting screen ask permission using the following code:

> If android version is greater than android 12 then bluetoothConnect permission is also required.

```dart
Future<bool> getPermissions() async {
  // In iOS permission are handle by OS.
  if (Platform.isIOS) return true;
  await Permission.camera.request();
  await Permission.microphone.request();
  await Permission.bluetoothConnect.request();

  while ((await Permission.camera.isDenied)) {
    await Permission.camera.request();
  }
  while ((await Permission.microphone.isDenied)) {
    await Permission.microphone.request();
  }
  while ((await Permission.bluetoothConnect.isDenied)) {
    await Permission.bluetoothConnect.request();
  }
  return true;
}
```
