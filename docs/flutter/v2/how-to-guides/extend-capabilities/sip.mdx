## Overview

Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Interconnect refers to the setup where two or more different SIP-based networks or systems are connected to enable the flow of voice traffic between them.

100ms SIP Interconnect makes it easy to integrate VoIP calls from external third-party services into 100ms WebRTC meetings, ensuring a seamless bridge to participants connected through 100ms Client SDKs over WebRTC.

## Identifying peers joining through SIP

`HMSPeer` contains a type property which is an enum of `HMSPeerType` that can be used to identify the type of peer. The type can be `regular` or `sip`.

```dart
class Meeting implements HMSUpdateListener, HMSActionResultListener{

    ...

    ///Checks whether a peer is SIP peer
    void isSIPPeer(HMSPeer peer){
        if(peer.type == HMSPeerType.sip){
            //Peer is a SIP peer
        } else {
            //Peer is a regular peer
        }
    }

    ...
}
```
