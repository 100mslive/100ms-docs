`Role` is a powerful concept that takes a lot of complexity away in handling permissions and supporting features like breakout rooms.

Each `HMSPeer` instance has a `role` property which returns an `HMSRole` instance. You can use this property to do the following:

1. Check what this Role is allowed to publish, that is, can it publish a video (and at what resolution)? Can it publish audio? Can it share a screen? Who can this role subscribe to?

    For example, a Student Role can only see the Teacher's video. This is can be discovered by checking `publishSettings` and `subscribeSettings` properties.

2. Check what actions this Role can perform. i.e can it change someone else's current Role, End the Meeting, or remove someone from the room? This is can be discovered by checking the `permissions` property.

In certain scenarios, you may want to change someone's role.

Imagine an audio room with 2 roles `speaker` and `listener`. Only someone with a `speaker` role can publish audio to the room while a `listener` can only subscribe.

Now at some point, the `speaker` may decide to nominate some `listener` to become a `speaker`.

This is where _Change Role_ capabilities come into play.

You may choose to do either:

1. [Single Peer Role Change](#single-peer-role-change): Change the role of a single peer to a specified one using the `changeRoleOfPeer` API

2. [Bulk Role Change](#bulk-role-change): Change the role of all peers with a certain role, to a specified one using the `changeRoleOfPeersWithRoles` API

## Single Peer Role Change

> Note: ðŸ”‘ `changeRoleOfPeer` is the same as `changeRole` but we have deprecated `changeRole` and it will be removed in future releases. So, Please
> use `changeRoleOfPeer`.

```dart
class Meeting  implements HMSUpdateListener, HMSActionResultListener{

    ...

    void changeRoleOfPeer({required HMSPeer peer,required HMSRole roleName,bool forceChange}) {
        ///[peer]: peer whose role needs to be changed
        ///[toRole]: the role which we want the peer to be in(destination role).
        ///[forceChange]: it indicates whether to change the role of a peer forcefully
        ///If set to `true` then the role will be changed without asking permission from the [peer]
        ///In case of `false` permissions will be asked and the role will be changed only after the request is accepted.
        ///[hmsActionResultListener]: an instance of a class which implements HMSActionResultListener
        //Here this is an instance of a class that implements HMSActionResultListener that is Meeting
        hmsSDK.changeRoleOfPeer(
        forPeer: peer,
        toRole: roleName,
        force: forceChange,
        hmsActionResultListener: this);
    }

    @override
    void onSuccess(
        {HMSActionResultListenerMethod methodType =
            HMSActionResultListenerMethod.unknown,
        Map<String, dynamic>? arguments}) {

            switch (methodType) {

            ...

            case HMSActionResultListenerMethod.changeRoleOfPeer:
            //Here we will receive the success callback
            break;
            ...
        }
    }

    @override
    void onException(
        {HMSActionResultListenerMethod methodType =
            HMSActionResultListenerMethod.unknown,
        Map<String, dynamic>? arguments,
        required HMSException hmsException}) {

            switch (methodType) {

                ...

                case HMSActionResultListenerMethod.changeRoleOfPeer:
                 // Check the HMSException object for details about the error
                break;
                ...
        }
    }
}
```

To invoke this method we will need 4 parameters.

-   `forPeer`: An instance of `HMSPeer` of the peer whose role you want to change.

-   `toRole`: The `HMSRole` instance for the target role.

-   `force`: Whether you want to change their role without asking them or give them a chance to accept/reject.

-   `hmsActionResultListener`: The `HMSActionResultListener` will get a success or failure callback depending on the result of the request.

> Note: success doesn't mean that the role was changed, just that the server accepted the request as valid.

If the changeRole was succeeded you will get an update in the `onPeerUpdate` with `roleUpdated`as update type,
With the same peer, you passed as `forPeer` and an `HMSPeerUpdate.roleUpdated` update type.

```dart
class Meeting  implements HMSUpdateListener, HMSActionResultListener{

  ...
  @override
  void onPeerUpdate({required HMSPeer peer, required HMSPeerUpdate update}) async {
    switch (update) {
      ...

      case HMSPeerUpdate.roleUpdated:
      //Here we will get the update with peer being the same as the `forPeer` we sent in changeRole
      break;

      ...
    }
  }
}
```

## Bulk Role Change

Bulk Role Change is used when we want to change the role of peers with a specific role to another role.

For example, if peers join a room with a `waiting` role and now you want to change all these peers to `viewer` role then use the `changeRoleOfPeersWithRoles` method.

```dart
class Meeting  implements HMSUpdateListener, HMSActionResultListener{

    ...

    void changeRoleOfPeersWithRoles(
      {required HMSRole toRole,
      required List<HMSRole> ofRoles,
      HMSActionResultListener? hmsActionResultListener}) {
        ///[toRole]: the role you wish to move peers into(destination role)
        ///[ofRoles]: List of roles whose role needs to be changed
        ///[hmsActionResultListener]: an instance of a class which implements HMSActionResultListener
        //Here this is an instance of a class that implements HMSActionResultListener that is Meeting
        hmsSDK.changeRoleOfPeersWithRoles(
        toRole: toRole,
        ofRoles: ofRoles,
        hmsActionResultListener: this);
    }

    @override
    void onSuccess(
        {HMSActionResultListenerMethod methodType =
            HMSActionResultListenerMethod.unknown,
        Map<String, dynamic>? arguments}) {

            switch (methodType) {

            case HMSActionResultListenerMethod.changeRoleOfPeer:
            break;

            case HMSActionResultListenerMethod.changeRoleOfPeersWithRoles:
            //Here we will receive the success callback
            break;
            ...
        }
    }

    @override
    void onException(
        {HMSActionResultListenerMethod methodType =
            HMSActionResultListenerMethod.unknown,
        Map<String, dynamic>? arguments,
        required HMSException hmsException}) {

            switch (methodType) {

                case HMSActionResultListenerMethod.changeRoleOfPeer:
                break;

                case HMSActionResultListenerMethod.changeRoleOfPeersWithRoles:
                 // Check the HMSException object for details about the error
                break;
                ...
        }
    }
}
```

### Edge cases with bulk role change

1. Note that if an empty list is sent to `ofRoles`, no roles will be changed. This is to avoid accidentally changing roles you may not have intended such as the bots that provide recording and streaming with the roles `beam`.

2. Also, Bulk Role Changes are always forced, that is, no option will be given for the peer to accept it, they will just be changed immediately.

### Let's have a look at an example of bulk role change

Here's how the method could be called to change all `waiting` and `guest` roles to `host`:

```dart
// fetch all available Roles in the room
List<HMSRole> roles = await hmsSDK.getRoles();

// get the Host Role object
HMSRole toHostRole = roles.firstWhere((element) => element.name == "host");

// get a list of Roles to be updated - in this case, "Waiting" and "Guest" Roles
roles.retainWhere((element) => ((element.name == "waiting") || (element.name == "guest")));

// now perform Role Change of all peers in "Waiting" and "Guest" Roles to the "Host" Role
hmsSDK.changeRoleOfPeersWithRoles(
    toRole: toHostRole,
    ofRoles: roles,
    hmsActionResultListener: hmsActionResultListener);
```

## Accept Role change Request

When a peer wishes to change the role of another peer it calls `changeRoleOfPeer` with a parameter `force`.
The `force` parameter in `changeRoleOfPeer`,

-   when `true` role is directly changed and the peer receives an `onPeerUpdate` with method type as `roleUpdated`.
-   when `false`, is a polite request: "Would you like to change your role from listener to speaker?" Which can be ignored by the peer. The way it works is the other peer will first receive an `onRoleChangeRequest` callback in `HMSUpdateListener`:

Let's understand this with a diagram:

![accept-change-role](/docs/v2/flutter-accept-role-change.png)

Now let's do it step-by-step:

<div className="steps-container">

### PeerA calls changeRoleOfPeer with force as false

```dart
//Assuming that HMSActionResultListener is implemented in the class where this function is being called
hmsSDK.changeRoleOfPeer(
        forPeer: peerB,
        toRole: new-role,
        force: false,
        hmsActionResultListener: this);
```

### PeerB receives onRoleChangeRequest

PeerB receives onRoleChangeRequest in the class wherever HMSUpdateListener is implemented.

```dart
class Meeting  implements HMSUpdateListener, HMSActionResultListener{

  ...

  @override
  void onRoleChangeRequest({required HMSRoleChangeRequest roleChangeRequest}) {
    //Show some popup asking for permissions
  }

}
```

At this point, the app should show a prompt to the user asking for permission to accept or deny role change.

#### How to extract info from HMSRoleChangeRequest to show popups for permission

`HMSRoleChangeRequest` is a class that contains info about the role change request.
It contains two attributes:

-   _suggestedRole_ -> This is an `HMSRole` object which contains info about the destination role
-   _suggestedBy_ -> This is an `HMSPeer` object which contains info about the peer who performed a role change

To get information like role name and peer who performed role change we can do it like :

```dart
class Meeting  implements HMSUpdateListener, HMSActionResultListener{

  ...

  @override
  void onRoleChangeRequest({required HMSRoleChangeRequest roleChangeRequest}) {
    String? peerWhoPerformedRoleChange = roleChangeRequest.suggestedBy?.name;
    String? destinationRole = roleChangeRequest.suggestedRole.name
  }
}
```

### PeerB calls acceptChangeRole

If the user wants to accept the request, the app should invoke `acceptChangeRole` on `HMSSDK` instance:

```dart
//roleChangeRequest: this is the same request which we received in onRoleChangeRequest
hmsSDK.acceptChangeRole(hmsRoleChangeRequest: roleChangeRequest, hmsActionResultListener: hmsActionResultListener);
```

### All the peers receive onPeerUpdate with type as roleUpdated

Now, all peers in the room will receive an `HMSPeerUpdate.roleUpdated` callback so that they can do the necessary UI updates.
PeerB will have all the permissions of new role.

</div>

#### Case with changeRoleOfPeer with `force` as true

Now let's imagine the newly nominated speaker is not behaving nicely and we want to move him back to the listener without a prompt. This is where the `force` parameter comes in.

When it is set to true the other party will not receive a confirmation `roleChangeRequest` but instead will straight away receive a new set of updated permissions and stop publishing.

`HMSPeerUpdate.roleUpdated` callback will still be fired so that the app can update the user's UI state.
