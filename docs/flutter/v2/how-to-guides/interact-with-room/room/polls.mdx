The Polls feature in the HMS SDK allows us to create, manage, and participate in Polls and Quizzes. Polls are an effective way to gather opinions, feedback, and insights from a group of people in a quick and convenient manner. With the Poll feature, we can create custom Polls, set their properties, add questions, and manage responses. We can also receive real-time updates on poll status, and view Poll Results in an organized and easy-to-use format.

This feature can also be used to create Quizzes. Under the hood, Quizzes are like Polls where questions have right or wrong answers.

This document provides guidance on how to use the Poll APIs to create a poll, receive updates on a poll, and vote on a poll.

## Prerequisites

-   Flutter SDK 1.9.9
-   Poll Read permissions should be enabled for roles that can view polls.
-   Poll Write permission should be enabled for roles that can create polls.

## Listen to poll updates

To listen to poll updates HMSSDK provides `HMSPollListener`. This listener keeps the application informed about various Poll-related events, including when a Poll is initiated, concluded, or when participants submit their responses.
Use the `addPollUpdateListener` method to start listening for updates. When you're done, use `removePollUpdateListener` to stop listening.

> `HMSPollListener` should be implemented in the class wherever Poll updates are required. It's essential to note that HMSPollListener follows the singleton pattern, meaning it can only be implemented in one class at a time.

```dart
class Meeting implements HMSUpdateListener, HMSPollListener{


    ///To attach a poll update listener we need to call [addPollUpdateListener]
    HMSPollInteractivityCenter.addPollUpdateListener(listener: this);

    @override
    void onPollUpdate({required HMSPoll poll, required HMSPollUpdateType pollUpdateType}){

        ///[poll] is the HMSPoll object containing info about poll.
        ///[pollUpdateType] is an enum of type HMSPollUpdateType with type as started, stopped and resultsupdated
    }

    ///To stop listening to poll updates call [removePollUpdateListener]
    HMSPollInteractivityCenter.removePollUpdateListener();
}
```

Let's look at `HMSPollUpdateType` enum:

```dart
enum HMSPollUpdateType {

    ///Indicates that a poll has been initiated and is now active.
    started,

    ///Indicates that a poll has concluded and is no longer active.
    stopped,

    ///Indicates that new results or responses have been submitted for the poll.
    resultsupdated
}
```

## Creating a Poll

### Quick Create

Here is how to quickly create a poll using poll builder.

Let's consider an example. We'll create a single-choice poll with the title `Survey` and the question `Do you love Dart?` The poll will offer two options: `Yes` and `No`.

```dart
class Meeting extends HMSUpdateListener, HMSPollListener{

    ...

    ///Create objects for [HMSPollBuilder] and [HMSPollQuestionBuilder]
    var pollBuilder = HMSPollBuilder();
    var questionBuilder = HMSPollQuestionBuilder();

    ///Set the poll title
    pollBuilder.withTitle = "Survey";

    ///Set the category
    pollBuilder.withCategory = HMSPollCategory.poll;

    ///Set the poll type to single choice
    questionBuilder.withType = HMSPollQuestionType.singleChoice;

    ///Set the poll question
    questionBuilder.withText = "Do you love dart?";

    ///Set poll options
    questionBuilder.withOption = ["yes", "no"];

    ///Add question to poll
    pollBuilder.addQuestion(questionBuilder);

    ///HMSPollInteractivityCenter is a singleton class containing poll methods
    ///Here we call the quickStartPoll method
    void createPoll(){
        HMSPollInteractivityCenter.quickStartPoll(pollBuilder: pollBuilder);
    }

    ...



    @override
    void onPollUpdate({required HMSPoll poll, required HMSPollUpdateType pollUpdateType}){

        ///We will get the update here with poll object and
        ///pollUpdateType as HMSPollUpdateType.started

    }

}
```

After calling `quickStartPoll` method we will get `onPollUpdate` with `HMSPollUpdateType` as `started`.

Above code will create a poll with a given title and a single choice question, and share it with the Room.

### Quiz Creation

Quiz assumes that correct answers are provided to each question which are then used to evaluate the userâ€™s score. Use question builder API to indicate which options are correct.

Let's consider an example. We'll create a single-choice quiz with the title `Quiz` and the question `What is the capital of India?`. The Quiz will offer two options: `Delhi` and `Mumbai`. The correct answer is `Delhi`.

```dart
class Meeting extends HMSUpdateListener, HMSPollListener{

    ...

    ///Create objects for [HMSPollBuilder] and [HMSPollQuestionBuilder]
    var pollBuilder = HMSPollBuilder();
    var questionBuilder = HMSPollQuestionBuilder();

    ///Set the Quiz title
    pollBuilder.withTitle = "Quiz";

    ///Set the category
    pollBuilder.withCategory = HMSPollCategory.quiz;

    ///Set the Quiz type to single choice
    questionBuilder.withType = HMSPollQuestionType.singleChoice;

    ///Set the Quiz question
    questionBuilder.withText = "What is the capital of India?";

    ///Set Quiz options
    List<HMSPollQuizOption> quizOptions = [];

    var optionDelhi = HMSPollQuizOption(text: "Delhi");
    optionDelhi.isCorrect = true;
    quizOptions.add(optionDelhi);

    var optionMumbai = HMSPollQuizOption(text: "Mumbai");
    optionMumbai.isCorrect = false;
    quizOptions.add(optionMumbai);

    questionBuilder.addQuizOption = quizOptions;

    ///Add question to poll
    pollBuilder.addQuestion(questionBuilder);

    ///HMSPollInteractivityCenter is a singleton class containing poll methods
    ///Here we call the quickStartPoll method
    void createQuiz(){
        HMSPollInteractivityCenter.quickStartPoll(pollBuilder: pollBuilder);
    }

    ...

    @override
    void onPollUpdate({required HMSPoll poll, required HMSPollUpdateType pollUpdateType}){

        ///We will get the update here with poll object and
        ///pollUpdateType as HMSPollUpdateType.started

    }

}

```

## Voting on a Poll

To participate in a poll, we can vote using `addSingleChoicePollResponse` or `addMultiChoicePollResponse` methods.
As the name suggests `addSingleChoicePollResponse` can be used to vote for a single choice poll, while `addMultiChoicePollResponse` method
can be used to vote for a multi choice poll.

Let's consider a example, A user wishes to answer `yes` to above poll.

```dart
class Meeting extends HMSUpdateListener, HMSPollListener{

    ...

    void answerPoll(){

        /**
        * [poll] - The poll object obtained from `onPollUpdate`.
        * [question] - The question being answered within the poll.
        * [pollQuestionOption] - The selected option for the poll question, e.g., `yes`.
        * [peer] - The participant answering the poll.
        */
        HMSPollInteractivityCenter.addSingleChoicePollResponse(
        hmsPoll: poll,
        pollQuestion: question,
        optionSelected: pollQuestionOption,
        peer: peer);

    }

    ...

    @override
    void onPollUpdate({required HMSPoll poll, required HMSPollUpdateType pollUpdateType}){

        ///We will get the update here with poll object and
        ///pollUpdateType as HMSPollUpdateType.started

    }

}
```

Once you have submitted your responses, everyone in the room will get `resultsUpdated` update in `onPollUpdate` callback.
You can check updated vote counts for each option from the poll object.

```dart
class Meeting extends HMSUpdateListener, HMSPollListener{

    ///List containing vote count for all the options for a question
    List<int> voteCountForOptions = [];

    @override
    void onPollUpdate({required HMSPoll poll, required HMSPollUpdateType pollUpdateType}){
        ///Here we are storing vote count for options from question 1 i.e. at 0th index
        poll.questions[0].options.forEach((option) => voteCountForOptions.add(option.voteCount));
    }

}
```

## Stopping a Poll

To stop a poll, HMSSDK provides `stopPoll` method.

```dart
class Meeting extends HMSUpdateListener, HMSPollListener{


    void stopPoll(){
        ///[poll] is the poll object from `onPollUpdate`
        HMSPollInteractivityCenter.stopPoll(poll: poll);
    }


    @override
    void onPollUpdate({required HMSPoll poll, required HMSPollUpdateType pollUpdateType}){
        ///Get poll updates here
    }

}
```

After calling the `stopPoll` function, the `onPollUpdate` event is triggered with a type of `stopped`, indicating that the poll has been stopped.

## Quiz Leaderboard

Upon quiz completion, users can retrieve a comprehensive summary including total votes, correct answers count, average score, and participant rankings.
The `fetchLeaderboard` method in `HMSSDK` simplifies the process of retrieving this leaderboard information.

Let's see how we can fetch leaderboard for a quiz:

```dart
class Meeting extends HMSUpdateListener, HMSPollListener{


    void fetchLeaderboard(HMSPoll quiz){
        
        ///[quiz]: HMSPoll - It is the poll object from `onPollUpdate`
        ///[count]: int - It denotes the number of peers you wish to fetch at once, in this example we are fetching first five peers
        ///[startIndex]: int - It is the offset from where you wish to fetch the leaderboard
        ///[includeCurrentPeer]: bool - It denotes whether you wish to include current/local peer in the leaderboard
        ///useful in edtech scenarios where including a teacher in a leaderboard is unnecessary.
        var leaderboardResponse = HMSPollInteractivityCenter.fetchLeaderboard(
                                    poll: quiz,
                                    count: 5,
                                    startIndex: startIndex,
                                    includeCurrentPeer: includeCurrentPeer);

        if (leaderboardResponse is HMSPollLeaderboardResponse){
            ///Render the leaderboard using the [leaderboardResponse]
        }else{
            ///Handle the error here
        }

    }


    @override
    void onPollUpdate({required HMSPoll poll, required HMSPollUpdateType pollUpdateType}){
        ///Get poll updates here
    }

}
```

## Poll methods

### fetchPollList

`fetchPollList` method is used to fetch list of polls/quiz with a given state. Let's see how we can fetch all the concluded polls.

```dart
class Meeting extends HMSUpdateListener, HMSPollListener{

    ///[hmsPollState]: the poll state for which polls need to be fetched
    var data = await HMSPollInteractivityCenter.fetchPollList(hmsPollState: HMSPollState.stopped);
    if (data is List<HMSPoll>) {
        ///[data] contains all the concluded polls
    }else{
         ///Handle the error here
    }
    
    @override
    void onPollUpdate({required HMSPoll poll, required HMSPollUpdateType pollUpdateType}){
        ///Get poll updates here
    }
}
```

### fetchPollQuestions

`fetchPollQuestions` method is used to fetch questions for the given poll.

```dart
class Meeting extends HMSUpdateListener, HMSPollListener{

    ///[hmsPoll]: the poll object for which questions need to be fetched, here poll
    ///is the poll for which questions need to be fetched
    var data = await _hmsSDKInteractor.fetchPollQuestions(hmsPoll: poll);

    if (data is List<HMSPollQuestion>) {
      ///[data] contains all the questions for the corresponding [poll]
    }else{
        ///Handle the error here
    }


    @override
    void onPollUpdate({required HMSPoll poll, required HMSPollUpdateType pollUpdateType}){
        ///Get poll updates here
    }
}
```

### getPollResults

`getPollResults` method is used to fetch results for given poll object.

```dart
class Meeting extends HMSUpdateListener, HMSPollListener{

    var data = await _hmsSDKInteractor.getPollResults(hmsPoll: poll);
    if (data is HMSPoll) {
        ///[data] contains the poll results
    }else{
        ///Handle the error here
    }

    @override
    void onPollUpdate({required HMSPoll poll, required HMSPollUpdateType pollUpdateType}){
        ///Get poll updates here
    }
}
```
