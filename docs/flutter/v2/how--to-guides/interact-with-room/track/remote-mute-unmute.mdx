title: Remote Mute/Unmute
nav: 8.3
---

You're running a video call room and decide that someone who's currently talking shouldn't be talking.

You'd prefer they'd stay mute. Or perhaps you want their video turned off as well as their audio. You're looking for a remote mute.

Muting can apply to both audio and video.

Let's understand the steps:

### Permissions

Can't let just anyone mute others. First, you need to create a [role](/concepts/v2/concepts/security-and-tokens) with the permissions to mute others and also to ask them to Unmute.

![Permissions - Remote mute/unmute](/guides/permissions.png)

The permission to mute others is within `PermissionsParams` `mute` and you should check for that within the `HMSRole` of the peer to see if they have it.

Similarly, the permission to Unmute other peers is within `PermissionsParams` `unmute`.

Here's how to check whether the local peer has permission to mute or Unmute others. You can do it like this:

```dart
Future<bool> isAllowedToMuteOthers() async{
    return (await hmsSDK.getLocalPeer()).role.permission!.mute;
}

Future<bool> isAllowedToUnMuteOthers(){
    return (await hmsSDK.getLocalPeer()).role.permission!.unMute;
}

```

`hmsSDK.getLocalPeer()` will not return null as long as you're in a preview or in a meeting room. Since you likely won't need to check for permissions if you're not in one So, it would be ok.

### Mute/Unmute other peers

`HMSSDK` provides dedicated methods to mute/unmute:

-   Individual peer
-   Specific role

These methods will only work if the peer has permission to mute/unmute another peer's audio/video. The permission can be checked as the steps mentioned
above.

Let's look at each of them:

### Individual peer

We can use the `changeTrackState` method to mute/unmute remote peer's audio/video

```dart

class Meeting implements HMSUpdateListener, HMSActionResultListener{

  ...

  void changeTrackState(HMSTrack forRemoteTrack, bool mute,
      HMSActionResultListener hmsActionResultListener) {
    /// [forRemoteTrack] : track whose state needs to be changed(mute -> unmute or unmute -> mute)
    /// Set [mute] to true if the track needs to be muted, false otherwise.
    ///[hmsActionResultListener]: an instance of a class that implements HMSActionResultListener
    //Here this is an instance of a class that implements HMSActionResultListener, that is, Meeting
    if(
    //peer has permission to change track state
    localPeer?.role.permissions.mute
    ){
      hmsSDK.changeTrackState(
        forRemoteTrack: forRemoteTrack,
        mute: mute,
        hmsActionResultListener: this);
    }
    else{
      //Peer doesn't have permission to mute/unmute other peers
    }

  }

    @override
    void onSuccess(
      {HMSActionResultListenerMethod methodType =
          HMSActionResultListenerMethod.unknown,
      Map<String, dynamic>? arguments}) {
          switch (methodType) {
          ...

          case HMSActionResultListenerMethod.changeTrackState:
          //Track state successfully changed
          break;
      }
  }


  @override
  void onException(
      {HMSActionResultListenerMethod methodType =
          HMSActionResultListenerMethod.unknown,
      Map<String, dynamic>? arguments,
      required HMSException hmsException}) {
          switch (methodType) {
          ...

          case HMSActionResultListenerMethod.changeTrackState:
          // Check the HMSException object for details about the error
          break;

      }
  }
}

```

If the `changeTrackState` method is successful we will get the `onSuccess` callback on HMSActionResultListener attached and track update in `onTrackUpdate`.

### Specific role

We can use the `changeTrackStateForRole` method to mute/unmute peers under specific roles.

```dart
class Meeting implements HMSUpdateListener, HMSActionResultListener{

  ...

  void changeTrackStateForRole(bool mute, HMSTrackKind? kind, String? source,
      List<HMSRole>? roles, HMSActionResultListener? hmsActionResultListener) {
      if(//peer has permission to change track state
        localPeer?.role.permissions.mute)
        {
            /// Set [mute] true if the track needs to be muted, false otherwise
            /// [kind] is the HMSTrackType that should be affected. If this and the source are specified, it is considered an AND operation. If not specified, all track sources are affected.
            /// [source] is the HMSTrackSource that should be affected. If this and type are specified, it is considered an AND operation. If not specified, all track types are affected.
            /// [roles] is a list of roles, that may have a single item in a list, whose tracks should be affected.
            //If not specified, all roles are affected.
            ///[hmsActionResultListener]: an instance of a class that implements HMSActionResultListener
            //Here this is an instance of a class that implements HMSActionResultListener, that is, Meeting
              HMSSDK.changeTrackStateForRole(
              mute: mute,
              kind: kind,
              source: source,
              roles: roles,
              hmsActionResultListener: this);

        }
      else{
      //Peer doesn't have permission to mute/unmute other peers
        }
    }


    @override
    void onSuccess(
      {HMSActionResultListenerMethod methodType =
          HMSActionResultListenerMethod.unknown,
      Map<String, dynamic>? arguments}) {
          switch (methodType) {
          ...

          case HMSActionResultListenerMethod.changeTrackState:
          break;

          case HMSActionResultListenerMethod.changeTrackStateForRole:
          //Track state successfully changed
          break;
      }
  }


  @override
  void onException(
      {HMSActionResultListenerMethod methodType =
          HMSActionResultListenerMethod.unknown,
      Map<String, dynamic>? arguments,
      required HMSException hmsException}) {
          switch (methodType) {
          ...

          case HMSActionResultListenerMethod.changeTrackState:
          break;

          case HMSActionResultListenerMethod.changeTrackStateForRole:
          // Check the HMSException object for details about the error
          break;

      }
  }
}

```

If the `changeTrackStateForRole` method is successful we will get the `onSuccess` callback and track update in `onTrackUpdate` similar to `changeTrackState`.

> If _roles_ is passed as an empty list then all the roles will get affected.

### Handling a mute callback

Mute callbacks are automatically applied to the receiver. No action is required.

### Handling an unmute callback

Let's turn the table now to what happens if a remote peer wishes to mute/unmute our audio/video.

-   In case when remote peer mutes our audio/video `HMSSDK` performs it automatically without asking permission In another case, we get the `onChangeTrackStateRequest` if
    we accept the request we need to call `toggleCameraMuteState` or `toggleMicMuteState` according to the request.

Let's understand this with a diagram:

![accept-change-track-state](/docs/v2/flutter-accept-track-change-request.png)

Now let's do it step-by-step:

<div className="steps-container">

### PeerA calls changeTrackState on PeerB's track

```dart
hmsSDK.changeTrackState(
        forRemoteTrack: "PeerB's track",
        mute: mute,
        hmsActionResultListener: this);
```

### PeerB receives onChangeTrackStateRequest

```dart
 @override
  void onChangeTrackStateRequest(
      {required HMSTrackChangeRequest hmsTrackChangeRequest}){}
```

How this is implemented in the example app can be found [here](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-flutter/blob/1537a82a2213c8bbb1b0eb2dcc009c171e89bad1/example/lib/data_store/meeting_store.dart#L736)

Let's look at the `HMSTrackChangeRequest` structure :

```dart
class HMSTrackChangeRequest {
  bool mute;
  HMSPeer requestBy;
  HMSTrack track;
}
```

This contains information on which track is requested for unmuting. Check the track type and call the unmute methods accordingly.

```dart
public void checkTrack(HMSTrack track) {
    if(track.kind == HMSTrackType.kHMSTrackKindAudio) {
        //Requested track is an audio track
    } else if (track.kind == HMSTrackType.kHMSTrackKindVideo) {
        //Requested track is a video track
    }
}
```

So final implementation looks like this:

```dart
class Meeting implements HMSUpdateListener, HMSActionResultListener{

  ...

  public void checkTrack(HMSTrack track) {
    if(track.kind == HMSTrackType.kHMSTrackKindAudio) {
        hmsSDK.toggleMicMuteState();
    } else if (track.kind == HMSTrackType.kHMSTrackKindVideo) {
        hmsSDK.toggleCameraMuteState();
    }
  }

  @override
  void onChangeTrackStateRequest(
      {required HMSTrackChangeRequest hmsTrackChangeRequest}){
          checkTrack(hmsTrackChangeRequest.track)
  }
}
```

### PeerB calls toggleMicMuteState/toggleCameraMuteState depending on the track kind

If the track is an audio track then PeerB calls `toggleMicMuteState`

```dart
hmsSDK.toggleMicMuteState();
```

If the track is a video track then PeerB calls `toggleCameraMuteState`

```dart
hmsSDK.toggleCameraMuteState();
```

Now all the peers will receive an `onTrackUpdate` with the type as `trackUnmuted`
