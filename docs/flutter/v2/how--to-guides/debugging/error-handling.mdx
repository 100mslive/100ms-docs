When you make an API call to access an HMS SDK, the SDK may return error codes. Error codes are returned when a problem that cannot be recovered without app intervention has occurred.

These are returned as `HMSException` in the `onHMSError` callback of the `HMSUpdateListener`.

Following are the different error codes that are returned by the SDK. Before returning any error code, SDK retries the errors\(whichever is possible\).

| **Error Code** | **Cause of the error**                                 | **Action to be taken**                                                                                      |

## HMSException

The SDK returns an error as an object of `HMSException` in `onHMSError` method.

```dart
@override
void onHMSError({required HMSException error}){
    //Handle Error
}
```

Let's have a look at the `HMSException` object

```dart
class HMSException {
  final String? id;

  //HMSException code
  final HMSExceptionCode? code;

  //Error message
  final String message;

  //Error description
  String description;

  //Action in which SDK failed
  String action;

  //Extra params sent with the error
  Map? params;

  //Whether the error is a terminal error or not
  bool isTerminal;
}
```

## Terminal Errors

Terminal errors are raised in cases when SDK has cleaned up the connection due to the error.
`isTerminal` property of HMSException object can be used to check whether the error is terminal.

Terminal error example:

![Terminal Error](/docs/v2/flutter-errorCode-1003.png)

The above error(`errorCode:1003`) occurs when the reconnection fails. The SDK returns this error after trying to reconnect for 60 seconds.
In such cases, the `isTerminal` property can be used to handle the UI updates.

## Setting log levels in SDK (Android Only)

100ms provides ability to save logs to disk on Android devices. These logs can be used to diagnose performance of room sessions. By default, logging is disabled, that is, set to `HMSLogLevel.OFF`. To enable logging, create the `HMSLogSettings` object & pass it while constructing the `HMSSDK` instance. This functionality of saving logs to Disk is not available on iOS.

```dart
// Create the Log Settings object
HMSLogSettings hmsLogSettings = HMSLogSettings(
        maxDirSizeInBytes: 1000000,
        isLogStorageEnabled: true,
        level: HMSLogLevel.VERBOSE);

hmsSDK = HMSSDK(
    hmsLogSettings: hmsLogSettings); // pass the Log Settings as a parameter while constructing the HMSSDK instance
```

`HMSLogLevel` is an enum with values:

```dart
enum HMSLogLevel {

  //To receive all the logs
  VERBOSE,

  //To receive warnings
  WARN,

  //To receive errors
  ERROR,

  //To turn OFF logs from SDK
  OFF,

  Unknown
}
```
