Logs are really helpful for debugging the issues. HMSSDK provides api's to get all the logs in a single callback.
To get the logs we will need to attach the `HMSLogListener` and override the `onLogMessage` method.
Also `HMSSDK` exposes a method `getAllLogs` to get all the native SDK logs at once according to the log levels we set in `startHMSLogger`.


## How to add logger in your application 

Let's check how we can add logging in our applications:

<div className="steps-container">

### Start HMSLogger 

To start listening to logs we need to call `startHMSLogger` with `HMSLogLevel` for both `webRTC` and `HMSSDK`.
`HMSLogLevel` is an enum as:

```dart 
enum HMSLogLevel {
  //To get all the logs
  VERBOSE,

  //To get warnings 
  WARN,

  //To only get error logs
  ERROR,

  //To turn off the logging 
  OFF,

  //This is the default level corresponding to OFF
  Unknown
}
```

Now let's see how we can call `startHMSLogger` to get only `Error logs` for WebRTC and `all logs` from SDK.

```dart
    hmsSDK.startHMSLogger(webRtclogLevel: HMSLogLevel.ERROR, logLevel: HMSLogLevel.VERBOSE);
```

### Listen to the logs from HMSLogger

To listen the logs from HMSSDK we need to implement the `HMSLogListener` in the class where we wish to get the logs 
& override the `onLogMessage` method.

```dart 
class Meeting  implements HMSUpdateListener, HMSActionResultListener,HMSLogListener{

    ...

    //Here this is an instance of a class that implements HMSLogListener that is Meeting
    hmsSDK.addLogListener(hmsLogListener: this);



    @override
    void onLogMessage({required HMSLogList hmsLogList}) {
        //Here we will get an object of HMSLogList
    }


    //Once we are done we can stop listening to logs by removing the HMSLogListener as:
    hmsSDK.removeLogListener(hmsLogListener: this);
    
    ...

}
```

>  `onLogMessage` doesn't provide instantaneous logs we batch them in group of 1000 and then send the updates.

### Stop HMSLogger

Once we are done with the logs we can stop the `HMSLogger` as:

```dart 
hmsSDK.removeHMSLogger();
```
</div>

## Get All the SDK logs at once 

To get all the SDK logs at once we can use `getAllLogs`. This returns an object of `HMSLogList` which contains 
a list of logs in `hmsLog` property.

> `getAllLogs` only returns logs if we have called `startHMSLogger` as mentioned above.

```dart 
    HMSLogList? logs = await hmsSDK.getAllLogs();

    logs?.hmsLog.forEach((element) {
        //Check the individual logs here
  });
```
