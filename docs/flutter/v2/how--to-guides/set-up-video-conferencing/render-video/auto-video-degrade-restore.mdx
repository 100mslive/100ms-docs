title: Auto Video Degrade/Restore
nav: 4.42

Sometimes people have bad internet connections but everyone deserves a good meeting.

When the network is too slow to support audio and video conversations together, the 100ms SDK can automatically turn off downloading other peer's videos, which may improve the audio quality and avoid disconnections.

If the network quality improves, the videos will be restored automatically as well.

To turn on subscribe degradation in your room, open the [templates](https://dashboard.100ms.live/templates) in the dashboard and enable it for roles there. Here's more information about [templates](/flutter/v2/foundation/templates-and-roles).

## Responding in the app

All `HMSVideoTrack`, within the `HMSPeer`'s have a variable called `isDegraded`.

If `isDegraded` is true, treat it as if the video is turned off. If the UI is not changed, the video tile will appear black.

## Video Track Update

We can listen to the track update of `trackDegraded` and `trackRestored` in `HMSTrackUpdate` to update the UI whenever someone's track gets changed due to degradation.

```dart
class Meeting implements HMSUpdateListener, HMSActionResultListener{

  ...

    @override
    void onTrackUpdate(
      {required HMSTrack track,
      required HMSTrackUpdate trackUpdate,
      required HMSPeer peer}) {

        switch (update) {

            case HMSTrackUpdate.trackDegraded:
            //Show as if video is turned off otherwise the tile becomes black
            break;

            case HMSTrackUpdate.trackRestored:
            //Switch to normal video as track is restored now
            break;

        }

    }
}
```
