## Getting Audio Levels for all speaking peers

We can find the currently speaking peers from `onUpdateSpeakers` method of `HMSUpdateListener`

```dart
class Meeting implements HMSUpdateListener, HMSActionResultListener{

  ...

  @override
  void onUpdateSpeakers({required List<HMSSpeaker> updateSpeakers}){
  // This is called every 1 second with list of active speakers
  }
}
```

Let's look at HMSSpeaker class

```dart
class HMSSpeaker {
  final HMSPeer peer;
  final HMSTrack track;
  final int audioLevel;
}
```

Let's understand the properties of HMSSpeaker class:

1. _audioLevel_ : int -> The level of the audio. It may vary from 0-100. A higher value indicates a higher speaking volume.
2. _track_ : HMSTrack -> The audio track corresponding to the speaker.
3. _peer_ : HMSPeer -> The peer who is speaking.

## Where can we use onUpdateSpeakers

### Active Speaker Views

To maintain an active speaker view, such as the default view in the [open source advanced sample app](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-flutter/tree/main/example), you need to keep track of who the active
speakers are over time. We'll be using the input from `onUpdateSpeakers` listener update as mentioned above and then building something that attempts to show all
the active speakers while minimizing re-ordering/re-building the list.

Checkout the active speaker mode [here](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-flutter/tree/main/example#application-settings-and-meeting-modes)

### Dominant Speaker - the loudest speaker.

The `updateSpeakers` list returned in `onUpdateSpeakers` is already in descending order based on the audioLevel.
So, the first element of the list will be loudest speaker.
