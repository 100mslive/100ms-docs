title: PIP Mode (beta)
nav: 4.9
---

100ms Flutter SDK provides support for creating Picture in Picture mode experience for video calls.

PIP Mode lets the user watch the room video in a small window pinned to a corner of the screen while navigating between apps or browsing content on the main screen.

## Minimum Requirements

-   Minimum version required to support PiP is Android 8.0 (API level 26) and iOS 15
-   Minimum `hmssdk_flutter` SDK version required is 1.3.0
-   To know more about PIP features, minimum version requirements for android please check [here](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/picture-in-picture).

## Android

### How to add PiP support

<div className="steps-container">

### Update the manifest file

You need to update the activity tag in the `AndroidManifest.xml`

```xml
<activity
    ....
    android:supportsPictureInPicture="true"
    android:configChanges="screenSize|smallestScreenSize|screenLayout|orientation"
    ... />
```

### Check PIP availablility

PIP mode only works above Android API Level 26(Android 8.0) but to check whether the current device supports PIP mode or not `HMSAndroidPIPController.isAvailable` method can be used:

```dart
bool _isPipAvailable = await HMSAndroidPIPController.isAvailable();
```

### Enter PIP mode

To show PIP mode in the application:

```dart
// enterPipMode is a Future<bool> function where true indicates that the application has entered pip mode successfully.
///[autoEnterPip] if true start pip mode will start automatically when app is minimized.For android 12 and above
///[aspectRatio]: List of int indicating ratio for PIP window as [width,height]
bool isPipEnteredSuccesfully = await HMSAndroidPIPController.start(autoEnterPip: true/false, aspectRatio: [16, 9]);
```

</div>

### How to check whether PIP is active

To check whether PIP mode is currently active use `isActive` method as:

```dart
bool isPipActive = await HMSAndroidPIPController.isActive();
```

> To display UI according to PIP use the `isActive` to set the state for PIP mode and render the UI accordingly.

### Checkout PIP in Action

How PIP mode is implemented in our example app. Checkout here:

<video controls>
    <source
        src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93931528/205587304-772a5dd6-ed64-4d9e-8bb5-4fc3eed83bea.mp4
"
        type="video/mp4"
    />
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

## iOS

### Check PIP availablility

PIP mode only works above iOS 15 but to check whether the current device supports PIP mode or not `HMSIOSPIPController.isAvailable` method can be used:

```dart
bool _isPipAvailable = await HMSIOSPIPController.isAvailable();
```

### Setup PIP

In iOS devices PIP is needed to be setup first for that call `HMSIOSPIPController.setup` with the following parameters:

**autoEnterPip** - Enable [autoEnterPip] will start pip mode automatically when app minimized. Default value is `true`

**aspectRatio** - Ratio for PIP window.List of int indicating ratio for PIP window as [width,height].For example: [16, 9], [9, 16] ,[1, 1]. Default value is `[16, 9]`.

**scaleType** - To set the video scaling. scaleType can be one of the following: [SCALE_ASPECT_FIT, SCALE_ASPECT_FILL, SCALE_ASPECT_BALANCED]. Default value is `ScaleType.SCALE_ASPECT_FILL`.More info about each of this can be found [here](/flutter/v2/how--to-guides/set-up-video-conferencing/render-video/overview#2-scaletype)

**backgroundColor** - To set the background colour when video is off that colour will be visible in background of PIP window. Default value is `Colors.black`.

```dart
  HMSIOSPIPController.setup(autoEnterPip: true, aspectRatio: [9, 16]);
```

> Note: Setup PIP function can be called like - onJoin, or on click of a button, or when a Screenshare starts etc

### Change Video Track

The `HMSIOSPIPController.changeVideoTrack` method is called when you want to change the HMSVideoTrack in PIP window. following are the parameters need to be passed at time of calling this method:

**track** - `HMSVideoTrack` object of the track which you wish to display needs to be passed for changing PIP window track.

**aspectRatio** - Ratio for PIP window.List of int indicating ratio for PIP window as [width,height].For example: [16, 9], [9, 16] ,[1, 1]. Default value is `[16, 9]`.

**alternativeText** - Alternative text is a textual substitute if HMSVideoTrack is muted.This is the text which you wish to display when video for peer is OFF while in PIP

**scaleType** - To set the video scaling. scaleType can be one of the following:

-   SCALE_ASPECT_FIT
-   SCALE_ASPECT_FILL
-   SCALE_ASPECT_BALANCED

Default value is `ScaleType.SCALE_ASPECT_FILL`.More info about each of this can be found [here](/flutter/v2/how--to-guides/set-up-video-conferencing/render-video/overview#2-scaletype)

**backgroundColor** - To set the background colour when video is off that colour will be visible in background of PIP window. Default value is `Colors.black`.

```dart
   HMSIOSPIPController.changeVideoTrack(
            track: videoTrack,
            aspectRatio: [9, 16],
            alternativeText: "peer Name",
            scaleType: ScaleType.SCALE_ASPECT_FILL,
            backgroundColor: Colors.blue
            );
```

> Note: changeVideoTrack method can be callled like - minimizing of app, onUpdateSpeakers or onTrackUpdate etc.

### Change Text

The `HMSIOSPIPController.changeText` method is called when you want to remove or show only text in PIP window. following are the parameters need to be passed at time of calling this method:

**text** - Text you want to show in PIP window. It will replace HMSVideoTrack if it playing in PIP window.

**aspectRatio** - Ratio for PIP window.List of int indicating ratio for PIP window as [width,height].For example: [16, 9], [9, 16] ,[1, 1]. Default value is `[16, 9]`.

**scaleType** - To set the video scaling. scaleType can be one of the following: [SCALE_ASPECT_FIT, SCALE_ASPECT_FILL, SCALE_ASPECT_BALANCED]. Default value is `ScaleType.SCALE_ASPECT_FILL`.More info about each of this can be found [here](/flutter/v2/how--to-guides/set-up-video-conferencing/render-video/overview#2-scaletype)

**backgroundColor** - To set the background colour when video is off that colour will be visible in background of PIP window. Default value is `Colors.black`.

```dart
  HMSIOSPIPController.changeText(
          text: "Peer Name",
          aspectRatio: [9, 16],
          scaleType: ScaleType.SCALE_ASPECT_FILL,
          backgroundColor: Colors.blue
          );
```

> Note: changeText method can be callled like - when HMSVideoTrack changes its mute status or want to show text when local peer is speaking.

### How to check whether PIP is active

To check whether PIP mode is currently active use `isActive` method as:

```dart
  bool isPipActive = await HMSIOSPIPController.isActive();
```

### Start PIP Manually

To start PIP manually call the following method:

```dart
  HMSIOSPIPController.start();
```

### Stop PIP Manually

To stop PIP manually call the following method:

```dart
  HMSIOSPIPController.stop();
```

### Destroy PIP

This method is called to destroy PIP window:

```dart
  HMSIOSPIPController.destroy();
```

> Note: This method can be call at time of changing role to `hls-viewer` role.
