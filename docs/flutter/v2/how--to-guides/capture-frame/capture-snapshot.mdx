title: Capture Snapshot
nav: 10.1
---

You can capture a snapshot of the video stream of a local or remote peer's video.

## Minimum Requirements

SDK version 1.3.0

## How to capture the snapshot

You can capture a snapshot of the video stream of a local or remote peer's video. To capture a snapshot, you call `captureSnapshot()` method on `HMSVideoTrack` instance to get a `Uint8List` containing a snapshot of the video stream.

```dart
  HMSVideoTrack videoTrack;
  ...

  //Capture snapshot will return a nullable Uint8List type.
  Uint8List? bytes = await videoTrack.captureSnapshot();
```

## Display image

To display an image use `Image.memory` widget which will take `Uint8List` as a parameter and return an `Image` widget.

```dart
  //Show Image in Image Widget
  if (bytes != null) {
    Image imageWidget = Image.memory(bytes);
    //Show image widget in widget tree.
  }
```

## Save Image

To save an image in gallery use a 3rd Party plugin `image_gallery_saver` which will take `Uint8List` as one of the parameter and save a image in gallery directly.

```dart
  //Save Image in Gallery
  if (bytes != null) {
    Map result = await ImageGallerySaver.saveImage(bytes, quality: 100, name: "imageName");
    //Use 3rd Party Plugin image_gallery_saver to save image in gallery.
  }
```
