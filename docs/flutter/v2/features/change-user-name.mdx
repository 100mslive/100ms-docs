Any peer can change their own name before or after joining a room. Before joining, the name would have to be specified in `HMSConfig` that is passed to the join method. This document shows how the name can be changed after joining.

## Responding to name changes

Whenever a remote peer's name is changed a callback will be received in `onPeerUpdate({required HMSPeer peer, required HMSPeerUpdate update})` of `HMSUpdateListener` where the `update` will be of type `HMSPeerUpdate.nameChanged`.

When this callback is received the UI for that peer should be updated as well.

## Changing the name

The peer who wants to change their name should call the following method on an `HMSSDK` instance.


```dart
void changeName(
      {required String name,
      required HMSActionResultListener hmsActionResultListener}) {
    hmsSDK.changeName(
        name: name, hmsActionResultListener: hmsActionResultListener);
      }
```
