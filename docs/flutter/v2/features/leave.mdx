Once you're done with the meeting and want to exit, call leave on the HMSSDK instance you created to join it.


Before calling leave,remove the `HMSUpdateListener` instance as:
```dart
hmsSDK.removeUpdateListener(updateListener);
```

To leave the meeting,call `leave` method of `HMSSDK` as :
```dart
hmsSDK.leave();
```
