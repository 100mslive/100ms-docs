title: Leave Room
nav: 3.05

Once you're done with the meeting and want to exit, call leave on the HMSSDK instance that you created to join the room.

Before calling leave, remove the `HMSUpdateListener` instance as:
```dart
//updateListener is the instance of class in which HMSUpdateListener is implemented
hmsSDK.removeUpdateListener(updateListener);
```

To leave the meeting, call the `leave` method of `HMSSDK` and pass the `hmsActionResultListener` parameter to get a success callback from SDK in the `onSuccess` override method as follow.

> You will need to implement the `HMSActionResultListener` interface in a class to get `onSuccess` and `onException` callback.
>  To know about how to implement `HMSActionResultListener`  check the docs [here](../features/action-result-listeners)

```dart
class Meeting implements HMSActionResultListener{
//this is the instance of class implementing HMSActionResultListener  
await hmsSDK.leave(hmsActionResultListener: this);

@override
  void onSuccess(
      {HMSActionResultListenerMethod methodType = HMSActionResultListenerMethod.unknown, Map<String, dynamic>? arguments}) {
        switch (methodType) {
          case HMSActionResultListenerMethod.leave:
          // Room leaved successfully
          // Clear the local room state
          break;
          ...
        }
      }
}
```
