We all like customization in apps as per our comfort, likes/dislikes etc.
Joining with muted audio/video is a customization that sets the microphone and camera state before joining the room.

By default `HMSSDK` keeps the microphone and camera on but by using this feature you can decide their state according to the use case.

## Join room with muted audio/video

To use this we need to set the `hmsVideoTrackInitState` property for video and `hmsAudioTrackInitState` in the `hmsTrackSetting`
of the `HMSSDK` constructor.

Here `trackInitialState` property of `HMSVideoTrackSetting` and `HMSAudioTrackSetting` is Enum of type `HMSTrackInitState` which has the possible values as:

```dart
enum HMSTrackInitState {

  //If the track needs to be kept mute while joining
  MUTED,

  //If the track needs to be kept unmute while joining
  UNMUTED,
}
```
#### Let's take an example to understand the implementation: 

1. For joining a room with muted audio/video these values need to be set in the `hmsTrackSetting` property as :

```dart
HMSTrackSetting trackSetting = HMSTrackSetting(
        //This is for joining with muted audio and unmuted video
        audioTrackSetting: HMSAudioTrackSetting(trackInitialState: HMSTrackInitState.MUTED),
        videoTrackSetting: HMSVideoTrackSetting(trackInitialState: HMSTrackInitState.UNMUTED));
```
2. While creating the `HMSSDK` object pass the `HMSTrackSetting` object created above :

```dart 
HMSSDK hmsSDK = HMSSDK(
        hmsTrackSetting: trackSetting);
```

3. Perform the other steps as usual i.e call the `build` method.

The user should be able to join the room with the microphone off and the camera turned on.
