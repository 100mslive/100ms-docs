Flutter SDK provides support for sharing the entire screen of the device to the room.

Please note that for a peer to share their screen, their role must have Screenshare enabled in the dashboard. Also select the appropriate resolution for the Screen share quality. 1080p is recommended for better text readability.

## Prerequisites

Let's first do some setup required for both the platforms 

### Android Setup

You also need to pass the intent from android native side to HMS SDK in the following way :

In your app's `MainActivity` add -

```kotlin
import live.hms.hmssdk_flutter.HmssdkFlutterPlugin
import android.app.Activity
import android.content.Intent
import live.hms.hmssdk_flutter.Constants

override fun onActivityResult(requestCode: Int, resultCode: Int, data: Intent?) {
super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)

    if (requestCode == Constants.SCREEN_SHARE_INTENT_REQUEST_CODE && resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK){
        HmssdkFlutterPlugin.hmssdkFlutterPlugin?.requestScreenShare(data)
    }

}

```
> DONOT forget to add the permission for foreground service in AndroidManifest.xml

```kotlin
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />
```

### iOS Setup

You need to create an iOS broadcast upload extension. It uses Apple's ReplayKit framework to record the device screen and delivers frame samples to your broadcast extension. You can share not only your own app but also the entire device sceeen including other apps on the device.

### Step 1 - Open project
Open your iOS Xcode project, such as `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` for full-Flutter apps.

### Step 2 - Add Broadcast Upload Extension
Click on your project in the Project Navigator to show the project settings. 
Press + at the bottom of the target list to add a new target.

![AddExtension](/docs/v2/flutter-xcode.png)

Select the `Broadcast Upload Extension` type for your new target.

![SelectExtension](/docs/v2/flutter-select-extension.png)

Enter your new target detail in the dialog.
Uncheck Include UI Extension option.

![DetailExtension](/docs/v2/flutter-extension-detail.png)

In the following dialog, activate the new scheme for the new target.

![ActivateExtension](/docs/v2/flutter-activate-extension.png)

### Step 3 - Add App Group

Click + icon in `Signing & Capabilities` section.
Select `App Group` from the list of Capabilities.

![AddAppgroup](/docs/v2/flutter-add-appgroup.png)

New section should be added under `Signing & Capabilities` named App Groups. Click + icon under that.

![Appgroup](/docs/v2/flutter-appgroup.png)

Enter App group name (create unique app group name ex: group.your.domain.name)

![AppgroupDetail](/docs/v2/flutter-appgroup-detail.png)

### Step 4 - Edit Podfile
In ios folder of your flutter project and open `Podfile`.
Paste the following code and replace the extension name you just created:
```
target 'Your Extension Name here' do
  use_modular_headers!
  pod 'HMSBroadcastExtensionSDK'
end
```
![Podfile](/docs/v2/flutter-podfile.png)

In terminal change directory to ios and run `pod install` command.

### Step 5 - Edit SampleHandler
Expand `Runner > ExtensionName` and open SampleHandler file.

![SampleHandler](/docs/v2/flutter-sample-handler.png)

Replace the code with the code below and pass app group name to the respected field:

```swift
import ReplayKit
import HMSBroadcastExtensionSDK

class SampleHandler: RPBroadcastSampleHandler {

    let screenRenderer = HMSScreenRenderer(appGroup: "Enter App Group Name")

    override func broadcastStarted(withSetupInfo setupInfo: [String : NSObject]?) {
        // User has requested to start the broadcast. Setup info from the UI extension can be supplied but optional.
    }

    override func broadcastPaused() {
        // User has requested to pause the broadcast. Samples will stop being delivered.
    }

    override func broadcastResumed() {
        // User has requested to resume the broadcast. Samples delivery will resume.
    }

    override func broadcastFinished() {
        // User has requested to finish the broadcast.
        screenRenderer.invalidate()
    }

    override func processSampleBuffer(_ sampleBuffer: CMSampleBuffer, with sampleBufferType: RPSampleBufferType) {
        switch sampleBufferType {
        case RPSampleBufferType.video:
            // Handle video sample buffer
            if let error = screenRenderer.process(sampleBuffer) {
                if error.code == .noActiveMeeting {
                    finishBroadcastWithError(NSError(domain: "ScreenShare",
                                                     code: error.code.rawValue,
                                                     userInfo: [NSLocalizedFailureReasonErrorKey : "You are not in a meeting."]))
                }
            }
            break
        case RPSampleBufferType.audioApp:
            // Handle audio sample buffer for app audio
            break
        case RPSampleBufferType.audioMic:
            // Handle audio sample buffer for mic audio
            break
        @unknown default:
            // Handle other sample buffer types
            fatalError("Unknown type of sample buffer")
        }
    }
}
```

#### Key Notes 

To start Screenshare from iOS devices you need to pass `App Group` and `Preferred Extension` name to `HMSSDK` constructor as shown below.

You can find `appGroup` and `preferredExtension` name in Xcode under Signing and Capabilities section under Target > yourExtensionName.

Once you have the correct App Group & Preferred Extension values created in Xcode & linked to your Apple Developer Account, you can now use them to start Screenshare from iOS devices (iPhone / iPad).


```dart
// Pass the correct App Group & Preferred Extension parameters while contructing the HMSSDK object
HMSSDK hmsSDK = HMSSDK(
    appGroup: "appGroup", // App Group value linked to your Apple Developer Account
    preferredExtension: "preferredExtension"); // Name of the Broadcast Upload Extension Target created in Xcode

hmsSDK.build();
```

After completing the setup let's see how we can Start the Screenshare from iOS.


## How to Start/Stop Screenshare from the app

To start screen share, app needs to call the `startScreenshare` method of `HMSSDK` and similar is it's counterpart `stopScreenShare` to stop screen share.

Following is the snippet on how to use this:

```dart
class Meeting implements HMSUpdateListener, HMSActionResultListener{

    void startScreenShare() {
        ///[hmsActionResultListener]: an instance of a class that implements HMSActionResultListener
        //Here this is an instance of a class that implements HMSActionResultListener i.e. Meeting
        hmsSDK.startScreenShare(hmsActionResultListener: this);
    }

    void stopScreenShare() {
        ///[hmsActionResultListener]: an instance of a class that implements HMSActionResultListener
        //Here this is an instance of a class that implements HMSActionResultListener i.e. Meeting
        hmsSDK.stopScreenShare(hmsActionResultListener: this);
    }

    @override
    void onSuccess(
      {HMSActionResultListenerMethod methodType =
          HMSActionResultListenerMethod.unknown,
      Map<String, dynamic>? arguments}) {
          switch (methodType) {
          ...

          
            case HMSActionResultListenerMethod.startScreenShare:
            //Screen share started successfully
            break; 

            case HMSActionResultListenerMethod.stopScreenShare:
            //Screen share stopped successfully
            break;
      }        
  }


  @override
  void onException(
      {HMSActionResultListenerMethod methodType =
          HMSActionResultListenerMethod.unknown,
      Map<String, dynamic>? arguments,
      required HMSException hmsException}) {
          switch (methodType) {
          ...

            case HMSActionResultListenerMethod.startScreenShare:
            // Check the HMSException object for details about the error
            break;

            case HMSActionResultListenerMethod.stopScreenShare:
            // Check the HMSException object for details about the error
            break;

      }
  }

}
```

## How to get Screen Share Status

Application needs to call the `isScreenShareActive` method of `HMSSDK`.

This method returns a `Boolean` which will be `true` incase ScreenShare is currently active and being used, and `false` for inactive state.

```dart
hmsSDK.isScreenShareActive();
```

## How to display screenshare in apps 

> Screenshare track can be differentiated from normal video track using track's `source` property as `track.source == "SCREEN"` for screenshare
>tracks

Screenshare can be rendered on the screen similar to normal videos.Checkout the implementation [here](../features/render-video) 


## Troubleshooting Guide

For starting Screenshare from iOS devices (iPhones or iPads) following are some common setup you should already have within your Apps -

- `Bitcode` Disabled: Bitcode has been disabled by Apple from Xcode 14 & iOS 16 and above. So 100ms packages also have Disabled Bitcode to ensure compatibility. Ensure that in your Xcode project Bitcode is Disabled for all Targets.

![Disable Bitcode in Xcode](/docs/v2/iOS-Xcode-Disable-Bitcode.png)


- `Background Modes` Enabled: In majority use-cases, playing audio from Room would be required when app is in Background Mode. Mostly, if users are starting Screenshare from their iPhones/iPads they would want to continue listening to audio from the Room.

![Enable Background Modes](enable-background-modes.png)


- Running on Simulator: Starting Screenshare from an iOS Simulator is not supported by Apple. You can start Screenshare only from an actual iOS device like an iPhone or iPad.
