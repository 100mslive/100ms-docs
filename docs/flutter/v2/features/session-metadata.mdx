Session Metadata is an alpha feature that allows you to set and get metadata on a given session.

> A session is defined as the period from when the first peer joins an empty room till the last peer leaves. 

The same room can have multiple sessions. During one session the metadata will be preserved. Once a session ends the session metadata will also be cleared, that is, when the last peer leaves.

### Limits

Since session metadata is an alpha feature, it does not have the following:
1. Locks to ensure consistency of the data. If two peers update it at the same time, it will be a race condition for which one succeeds last, overwriting whatever was before.
2. SDKs are not made aware of session metadata updates on their own. This has to be done manually. One suggested way is listed [below](#updating-session-metadata-manually).

#### Set Session Metadata
Any peer can set the session metadata by calling `setSessionMetadata` and passing `String` value to its metadata parameter.

```dart
//hmsActionResultListener is the HMSActionResultListener that you attach, this is an optional parameter
//but we suggest .adding it as it notifies about the success or failure of the function call
hmsSDK.setSessionMetadata(metadata: "ENTER METADATA HERE", hmsActionResultListener: hmsActionResultListener);
```
> You will receive an update on `onSuccess` Callback after successfully setting metadata in `HMSActionResultListenerMethod.setSessionMetadata`.

### Get Session Metadata
Any peer can get metadata by calling `getSessionMetadata`.

```dart
String? metadata = await hmsSDK.getSessionMetadata();
```

### Updating session metadata manually

Since no updates are sent for session metadata as it is an alpha feature, here is one suggested way of getting peers to receive it once set.

One way to notify other apps of a change in session metadata is to send a custom broadcast message when a set succeeds. The type can be set to something like "metadata" or whatever you choose and this should then be handled in the `onMessage` of all apps. To `getSessionMetadata` at that time instead of showing a message for that type.

`onSuccess` callback sends a broadcast message as follows:

```dart
 @override
  void onSuccess(
      {HMSActionResultListenerMethod methodType =
          HMSActionResultListenerMethod.unknown,
      Map<String, dynamic>? arguments}) {
        switch (methodType){
            case HMSActionResultListenerMethod.setSessionMetadata:
                hmssdk.sendBroadcastMessage(message: "refresh", type: "metadata", hmsActionResultListener:hmsActionResultListener);
                break;
        }
      }
```

`onMessage` callback checks for message type and update session Metadata value.

```dart
  @override
  void onMessage({required HMSMessage message}) {
    if(message.type=="metadata") {
        getSessionMetadata();
        return;
    }
  }
```
