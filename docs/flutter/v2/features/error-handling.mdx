When you make an API call to access an HMS SDK, the SDK may return error codes. ErrorCodes are returned when a problem that cannot be recovered without app intervention has occurred.

These are returned as `HMSException` in the onHMSError callback of the `HMSUpdateListener`.

Following are the different error codes that are returned by the SDK . Before returning any error code, SDK retries the errors\(whichever is possible\).

| **Error Code** | **Cause of the error**                                 | **Action to be taken**                                                                                     |
| :------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## HMSException

The SDK returns error as an object of `HMSException` in `onHMSError` method.

```dart
@override
void onHMSError({required HMSException error}){
    //Handle Error
}

```

Let's have a look at the `HMSException` object 
```dart
class HMSException {
  final String? id; 

  //HMSException code
  final HMSExceptionCode? code;

  //Error message
  final String message;

  //Error description 
  String description; 

  //Action in which SDK failed
  String action; 
   
  //Extra params sent with the error
  Map? params;

  //Whether the error is a terminal error or not
  bool isTerminal;
}

```

## Terminal Errors 

Terminal errors are raised when SDK has cleaned up the connection due to the error.

`isTerminal` property of HMSException object can be used to check whther the error is a terminal error.

> ğŸ’¡ Note: `isTerminal` denotes if the SDK has cleaned up the connection due to the error or not.
If this is [true] it denotes that the error has removed user from the room
   else it denotes that user is still in the room even with the error.


Hence `isTerminal` property can be used to handle the UI as if `isTerminal:true` we can navigate user back to home screen or show them a popup.
While in other case the error can be handled accrodingly.

Example of a terminal error:

![Terminal Error](/docs/v2/flutter-errorCode-1003.png)

Above error(`errorCode:1003`) occurs when the reconnection fails.The SDK returns this error after trying to reconnect for 60 seconds.
In such cases the `isTerminal` property can be used to handle the UI updates.
