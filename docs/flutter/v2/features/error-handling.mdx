title: Error Handling

When you make an API call to access an HMS SDK, the SDK may return error codes. Error codes are returned when a problem that cannot be recovered without app intervention has occurred.

These are returned as `HMSException` in the `onHMSError` callback of the `HMSUpdateListener`.

Following are the different error codes that are returned by the SDK. Before returning any error code, SDK retries the errors\(whichever is possible\).

| **Error Code** | **Cause of the error**                                 | **Action to be taken**                                                                                      |

## HMSException

The SDK returns an error as an object of `HMSException` in `onHMSError` method.

```dart
@override
void onHMSError({required HMSException error}){
    //Handle Error
}
```
Let's have a look at the `HMSException` object 
```dart
class HMSException {
  final String? id; 

  //HMSException code
  final HMSExceptionCode? code;

  //Error message
  final String message;

  //Error description 
  String description; 

  //Action in which SDK failed
  String action; 
   
  //Extra params sent with the error
  Map? params;

  //Whether the error is a terminal error or not
  bool isTerminal;
}
```

## Terminal Errors 

Terminal errors are raised when SDK has cleaned up the connection due to the error.
`isTerminal` property of HMSException object can be used to check whether the error is terminal.

> 💡 Note: `isTerminal` denotes if the SDK has cleaned up the connection due to the error or not.
If this is [true] it denotes that the error has removed the user from the room
   else it denotes that the user is still in the room even with the error.


Hence `isTerminal` property can be used to handle the UI as if `isTerminal:true` we can navigate the user back to the home screen or show them a popup.
While in another case the error can be handled accordingly.

Terminal error example:

![Terminal Error](/docs/v2/flutter-errorCode-1003.png)

The above error(`errorCode:1003`) occurs when the reconnection fails. The SDK returns this error after trying to reconnect for 60 seconds.
In such cases, the `isTerminal` property can be used to handle the UI updates.

> 🔑  More info on reconnection handling can be found [here](./reconnection-handling)

## Setting log levels in SDK

`HMSSDK` sends all the logs from SDK by default. This makes debugging difficult.`HMSSDK` provides log levels to only receive logs 
which are relevant.Log levels can be set as:

```dart
//To turn off logs set HMSLogLevel as OFF
HMSLogSettings hmsLogSettings = HMSLogSettings(
        maxDirSizeInBytes: 1000000,
        isLogStorageEnabled: true,
        level: HMSLogLevel.OFF);

hmsSDK = HMSSDK(
    appGroup: appGroup,
    preferredExtension: preferredExtension,
    hmsLogSettings: hmsLogSettings,//Pass the settings while creating HMSSDK instance
    hmsTrackSetting: trackSetting);
```

`HMSLogLevel` is an enum with values:

```dart
enum HMSLogLevel {

  //To receive all the logs
  VERBOSE,

  //To receive warnings
  WARN,

  //To receive errors
  ERROR,

  //To turn OFF logs from SDK
  OFF,

  Unknown
}
```
