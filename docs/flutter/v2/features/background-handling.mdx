To keep the app running in the background even after the device goes into sleep mode then we need to add background permission in the app for android and iOS both.

## Android

In Android, if you want to speak in sleep mode then Android OS allow it for around 60 seconds (depend on OS) by default but if you want to continue it for more than allowed time then we have to use 3 party plugin [flutter_foreground_task](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_foreground_task) which allows the app to run in the foreground with a notification.

Here is step by step guide how to integrate flutter_foreground_task in application for 100ms SDK.

> Note: Playing Audio works fine without using Foreground Service as well.

<div className="steps-container">

### Add plugin
Add `flutter_foreground_task` as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file.
```
dependencies:
  flutter_foreground_task: "3.10.0"
```

### Adding Service in `AndroidManifest.xml`

Add service inside `<application>` tag as follows:
```
<application>
    ...
     <activity>
        ...
     </activity>

<service android:name="com.pravera.flutter_foreground_task.service.ForegroundService" />

</application>
```

### Start Foreground Service
Wrap meeting page with `WillStartForegroundTask` widget as follows:
```dart
@override
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return MaterialApp(
    // A widget to start the foreground service when the app is minimized or closed.
    // This widget must be declared above the [Scaffold] widget.
    home: WillStartForegroundTask(
      onWillStart: () async {
        // Return whether to start the foreground service.
        return true;
      },
      androidNotificationOptions: AndroidNotificationOptions(
        channelId: 'notification_channel_id',
        channelName: 'Foreground Notification',
        channelDescription: 'This notification appears when the foreground service is running.',
        channelImportance: NotificationChannelImportance.LOW,
        priority: NotificationPriority.LOW,
        iconData: NotificationIconData(
          resType: ResourceType.mipmap,
          resPrefix: ResourcePrefix.ic,
          name: 'launcher',
        ),
      ),
      iosNotificationOptions: const IOSNotificationOptions(
        showNotification: false,
        playSound: false,
      ),
      foregroundTaskOptions: const ForegroundTaskOptions(
        interval: 5000,
        autoRunOnBoot: false,
        allowWifiLock: false,
      ),
      notificationTitle: 'Foreground Service is running',
      notificationText: 'Tap to return to the app',
      callback: startCallback,
      child: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Your App Title'),
          centerTitle: true,
        ),
        body: MeetingApp(),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```
</div>
