title: Change Role

`Role` is a powerful concept that takes a lot of complexity away in handling permissions and supporting features like breakout rooms. 

Each `HMSPeer` instance has a `role` property which returns an `HMSRole` instance. You can use this property to do the following:

Check what this role is allowed to publish. Can it publish video (and at what resolution)? Can it publish audio? Can it share a screen? Who can this role subscribe to?

This is can be discovered by checking the `publishSettings` and `subscribeSettings` properties.


Check what actions this role can perform. i.e can it change someone else current role, end the meeting, or remove someone from the room This is can be discovered by checking the permissions property.


In certain scenarios, you may want to change someone's role. Imagine an audio room with 2 roles `speaker` and `listener`. Only someone with a `speaker` role can publish audio to the room while a `listener` can only subscribe. Now at some point, `speaker` may decide to nominate some `listener` to become a `speaker`. This is where the `changeRole` API comes in.


To invoke the API you will need 2 things - 

An instance of the `HMSPeer` of the peer whose role you want to change and the `HMSRole` instance for the target role. 

All the peers that are in the current room are accessible via peers property of the `HMSRoom` instance that you can get via room property of HMSSDK instance after successful room join. 

A list of all available roles in the current room can be accessed via the `getRoles` method of `HMSSDK`

Once you have both you can invoke.

```dart 
hmsSDK.changeRole(peerId,roleName,forceChange);
```

`peer`: the HMSPeer object of the peer.

`roleName`: name of the role.

`forceChange`: Optional boolean value. Set to `true` if you want to force the role change without the peer's explicit acceptance.


If the change role succeeds you will get an update in the `HMSUpdateListener` of `ROLE_CHANGED` update type:

```dart
void onPeerUpdate({required HMSPeer peer, 
required HMSPeerUpdate update});
```

With the same peer, you passed as targetPeer and a `HMSPeerUpdate.roleUpdated` update type.

The `force` parameter in `changeRole`, when false, is basically a polite request: "Would you like to change your role from listener to speaker?" Which can be ignored by the peer. The way it works is the other peer will first receive a `onRoleChangeRequest` callback in `HMSUpdateListener`:


```dart
void onRoleChangeRequest({required HMSRoleChangeRequest roleChangeRequest});
```

At this point, the app should show a prompt to the user asking for permission to accept or deny role change. 

If the user wants to accepts the request, the app should invoke `acceptRoleChangeRequest` on `HMSSDK` instance:

```dart
hmsSDK.acceptRoleChangeRequest();
```

Now, both all peers in room will receive a `HMSPeerUpdate.roleUpdated` callback so that they both can do necessary UI updates. Now the user actually becomes a speaker and the audio publishing will start automatically.

{/* Now let's imagine the newly nominated speaker is not behaving nicely and we want to move him back to the listener without a prompt. This is where the force parameter comes in. */}

When it is set to true the other party will not receive a confirmation `roleChangeRequest` but instead will straight away receive a new set of updated permissions and stop publishing. 


`HMSPeerUpdate.roleUpdated` callback will still be fired so that the app can update the user's UI state.
