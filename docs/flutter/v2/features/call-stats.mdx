title: Call Stats
nav: 3.20
---

Sometimes you need a way to capture certain metrics related to a call. This may be helpful if you want to tailor the experience to your users or debug issues. Typical metrics of interest are audio/video bitrate, round trip time, total consumed bandwidth and packet loss. 100ms SDK provides this data via dedicated delegate callbacks found in `HMSUpdateListener`. These will be called with a fixed interval of one second after a room has been joined. You can get stats on a per track basis ( `onRemoteAudioStats`) or as an overall summary (`onRTCStats`) 

Here is the full list of callbacks:

```dart
/// This callback provides stats for a local audio track.
void onLocalAudioStats({required HMSLocalAudioStats hmsLocalAudioStats, required HMSLocalAudioTrack track, required HMSPeer peer})

/// This callback provides stats for a local video track.
void onLocalVideoStats({required HMSLocalVideoStats hmsLocalVideoStats, required HMSLocalVideoTrack track, required HMSPeer peer})

/// This callback provides stats for a remote audio track.
 void onRemoteAudioStats({required HMSRemoteAudioStats hmsRemoteAudioStats, required HMSRemoteAudioTrack track, required HMSPeer peer})

/// This callback provides stats for a remote video track.
  void onRemoteVideoStats({required HMSRemoteVideoStats hmsRemoteVideoStats, required HMSRemoteVideoTrack track, required HMSPeer peer})

/// This callback provides combined stats for the session.
void onRTCStats({required HMSRTCStatsReport hmsrtcStatsReport})
```

## HMSRTCStatsReport

This class will contain the combined stats for the room.

```dart
class HMSRTCStats {
  // Total bytes sent in the current session.
  int bytesSent;
  // Total bytes received in the current session.
  int bytesReceived;
  // Total packets received in the current session.
  int packetsReceived;
  // Total packets lost in the current session.
  int packetsLost;
  // Total outgoing bitrate observed since previous report.
  double bitrateSent;
  // Total incoming bitrate observed since previous report in Kb/s.
  double bitrateReceived;
  // Average round trip time observed since previous report in Kb/s.
  double roundTripTime;
}

class HMSRTCStatsReport {
  // Combined audio + video values
  HMSRTCStats combined;
  // Summary of all audio tracks
  HMSRTCStats audio;
  // Summary of all video tracks
  HMSRTCStats video;
}
```

## HMSLocalAudioStats

This class contains stats related to local audio track.

```dart
class HMSLocalAudioStats {
	// Round trip time observed since previous report.
	double roundTripTime;
	// Total bytes sent by this track in the current session.
	int bytesSent;
	// Outgoing bitrate of this track observed since previous report in Kb/s.
  double bitrate;
}
```

## HMSLocalVideoStats

This class contains stats related to local video track.

```dart
class HMSLocalVideoStats {
	// Round trip time observed since previous report.
  double roundTripTime;
	// Total bytes sent by this track in the current session.
	int bytesSent;
	// Outgoing bitrate of this track observed since previous report in Kb/s.
  double bitrate;
	// Resolution of video frames being sent.
	double frameRate;
	// Frame rate of video frames being sent (FPS).
  HMSVideoResolution resolution;
}
```

## HMSRemoteAudioStats

This class contains stats related to remote audio track.

```dart
class HMSRemoteAudioStats {
	// Packet Jitter measured in seconds for this track. Calculated as defined in section 6.4.1. of RFC3550.
  double jitter;
	// Total bytes received by this track in the current session.
  int bytesReceived;
	// Incoming bitrate of this track observed since previous report in Kb/s.
  double bitrate;
	// Total packets received by this track in the current session.
  int packetsReceived;
	// Total packets lost by this track in the current session.
	int packetsLost;
}
```

## HMSRemoteVideoStats

This class contains stats related to remote video track.

```dart
class HMSRemoteVideoStats {
	// Packet Jitter measured in seconds for this track. Calculated as defined in section 6.4.1. of RFC3550.
  double jitter;
	// Total bytes received by this track in the current session.
  int bytesReceived;
	// Incoming bitrate of this track observed since previous report in Kb/s.
	double bitrate;
	// Total packets received by this track in the current session.
  int packetsReceived;
	// Total packets lost by this track in the current session.
	int packetsLost;
	// Resolution of video frames being received.
	HMSVideoResolution resolution;
	// Frame rate of video frames being received (FPS).
	double frameRate;
}
```
