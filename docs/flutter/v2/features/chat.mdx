What's a video call without being able to send messages to each other too? 100ms supports chat for every video/audio room you create.

You can see an example of every type of message (of the types below) being sent and displayed in the advanced [sample app](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-android/).

### Addressing messages

* [Broadcast messages](#sending-broadcast-messages) are sent to Everyone in the chat `hmsSDK.sendBroadcastMessage`.

* [Direct messages](#sending-direct-messages) are sent to a specific person `hmsSDK.sendDirectMessage`.

* [Group messages](#sending-group-messages) are sent to everyone with a particular `HMSRole`. Such as all `hosts` or all `teachers` or all `students` `hmsSDK.sendGroupMessage`.
    * Learn more about [roles](../foundation/templates-and-roles) and how to create them on the backend.

## Sending Chat Messages


### Sending Broadcast Messages

Want to let everyone in the chat know something? Call `sendBroadcastMessage` on the instance of `HMSSDK` to send a broadcast.

The parameters are:

1. *message*: The text of the message.


> ðŸ’¡ Note that the callback only lets you know if the server has received your request for the message or if there was some error.
>
>It does not convey whether the message was delivered to or read by the recipient.
>
>Also it's important to make a new callback per message because it will only contain the results of that particular call for sending a message.


```dart
hmsSDK.sendBroadcastMessage(message: "Hi", hmsActionResultListener: hmsActionResultListener);
```

#### Sending Direct Messages

Got secrets to share? Send a message directly to a single person in the chat with a direct message. Call `sendDirectMessage` on an instance of `HMSSDK`.

The parameters are:

1. *message*: The text of the message.
2. *peerTo*: The `HMSPeer` instance id  who should receive message.


> ðŸ’¡ Note that the callback only lets you know if the server has received your request for the message or if there was some error.
>
>It does not convey whether the message was delivered to or read by the recipient.
>
>Also it's important to make a new callback per message because it will only contain the results of that particular call for sending a message.



```dart
hmsSDK.sendDirectMessage(
        message: "Hi",
        peerTo: peerTo,
        hmsActionResultListener: hmsActionResultListener);
```


#### Sending Group Messages

Need to call attention to all the hosts? All the teachers? All the developers? Call `sendGroupMessage` on an instance of `HMSSDK`.

The parameters are:

1. *message*: The text of the message.
2. *hmsRolesTo*: The name of the role.


> ðŸ’¡ Note that the callback only lets you know if the server has received your request for the message or if there was some error.
>
>It does not convey whether the message was delivered to or read by the recipient.
>
>Also it's important to make a new callback per message because it will only contain the results of that particular call for sending a message.

```dart
hmsSDK.sendGroupMessage(message: "Hi",
        hmsRolesTo: hmsRolesTo,
        hmsActionResultListener: hmsActionResultListener);
```

### Receiving Chat Messages

When you called `hmsSDK.join(config)` to join a room, the `HMSUpdateListener` implementation that was passed in had the callback `void onMessage({required HMSMessage message});`.

This where you'll receive new messages as `HMSMessage` during the call. It contains:

```dart
class HMSMessage(

  final HMSPeer? sender;
  final String message;
  final String type;
  final DateTime time;
  HMSMessageRecipient? hmsMessageRecipient;

  HMSMessage({
    required this.sender,
    required this.message,
    required this.type,
    required this.time,
    this.hmsMessageRecipient
  });
)
```

* *message*: Content of the text message or the text description of the raw message.
* *type*: Type of message sent. Default value is `chat`.
* *hmsMessageRecipient*: The intended recipient(s) of this message as a `HMSMessageRecipient`.
* *time*: DateTime of when the messaging server receives this message. Update the time in your own messages when this comes back from the server in `HMSUpdateListener.onMessageReceived` for accurate ordering of your own messages.
* *sender*: The `HMSPeer` who is sending this message.

`Identifying Senders`:

The sender of a message is always contained in the `sender` field of HMSMessage. This lets you get the name and peer id for any message sender.

`Message Body`:

The body of the message is in `message` as a String.

`Time`:

The time the message was sent is contained in `time` as a DateTime datatype.

### Putting together a list of chat messages.
The UI is completely up to you to decide! You'll also need to hold onto all the received messages if you want to display history.

#### Identifying who the message was for

The HMSMessageRecipient contained in the `hmsMessageRecipient` field of `HMSMessage` lets you know who the message was for.

The `HMSMessageRecipient` contains:

```dart
class HMSMessageRecipient{
    HMSPeer? recipientPeer;
    List<HMSRole>? recipientRoles;
    HMSMessageRecipientType hmsMessageRecipientType;
}
```

`recipientPeer`: Only contains a peer when a specific single peer is being direct messaged.

`recipientRoles`: Only contains values when a group message is being sent to many roles.

`hmsMessageRecipientType`: Can contain enum value `BROADCAST`, `PEER` and `ROLES`.

- `HMSMessageRecipientType.BROADCAST` for a message being sent to everyone. If this is true, the other two fields will be null and empty respectively.

- `HMSMessageRecipientType.PEER` will be set when it's a direct message.

- `HMSMessageRecipientType.ROLES` will be set when it's a message to one or many roles.

### Store Chat Messages

You can store chat message by creating a list of `HMSMessage` and append new messages from the callback `onMessage({required HMSMessage message})` as follow:

```dart
List<HMSMessage> messages = [];

@override
void onMessage({required HMSMessage message}) {
  messages.add(message);
}
```

### Filter Chat Messages

You can filter chat message by creating a separate list of `HMSMessage`.

```dart
List<HMSMessage> broadcastList = [];
List<HMSMessage> rolesList = [];
List<HMSMessage> peerList = [];

List<HMSMessage> messageFilter(List<HMSMessage> messages, HMSMessageRecipientType type) {
  filterList = [];
  for(HMSMessage message in messages) {
    // Filter list on the basis of Broadcast chat.
    if(message.hmsMessageRecipient.hmsMessageRecipientType == HMSMessageRecipientType.BROADCAST) {
      broadcastList.add(message);
    }

    // Filter list on the basis of Roles chat.
    if(message.hmsMessageRecipient.hmsMessageRecipientType == HMSMessageRecipientType.ROLES) {
      rolesList.add(message);
    }

    // Filter list on the basis of Peer chat.
    if(message.hmsMessageRecipient.hmsMessageRecipientType == HMSMessageRecipientType.PEER) {
      peerList.add(message);
    }
  }
}
```
### Advance use cases  

Sometimes the app requires to show messages in different styles.Something similar to this:

![Chat](/docs/v2/flutter-chat.gif)

HMSSDK provides the `type` parameter of `HMSMessage` object to take care of such use cases.Just filter out the messages based on `type` 
parameter and handle the UI accordingly.

```dart
//Example to show emoticons when the message type is set to `emoji`
@override
void onMessage({required HMSMessage message}) {
  if(message.type=="emoji"){
      //Show as emoticons on UI
  }
  else{
    //Handle other cases
  }
}
```
