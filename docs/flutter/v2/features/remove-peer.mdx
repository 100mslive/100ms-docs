Someone's overstayed their welcome and now you need to remove a peer from the video call room.HMSSDK's `removePeer` comes to rescue.

Let's look at this step-by-step

<div className="steps-container">

### Permissions

Can't let just anyone remove others from the video call room. First you need to create a [role](../foundation/templates-and-roles) with the permissions to remove others.

In the SDK, the permission to remove others from the room is within `PermissionsParams` `removeOthers` and you should check for that within the `HMSRole` of the peer to see if they have it.

Here's how to check whether the local peer has the permission to end the room:

```dart
bool isAllowedToRemovePeer() async{
  return (await hmsSDK.getLocalPeer()).role.permission!.removeOthers;
}
```

`hmsSDK.getLocalPeer()` will not return null as long as you're in a preview or in a meeting room. Since you likely won't need to check for permissions if you're not in one it would be ok.

### Removing a peer

Once the permissions are checked to ensure the caller has the permission to remove a peer, remove them by calling `hmsSDK.removePeer`.

```dart
class Meeting implements HMSUpdateListener, HMSActionResultListener{

  ...

  void removePeer(
      {required HMSPeer peerToRemove,
      required String reason}) {
      ///[peerToRemove]: HMSPeer that needs to be removed from room
      ///[reason]: Reason for removal
      ///[hmsActionResultListener]: an instance of a class that implements HMSActionResultListener
      //Here this is an instance of a class that implements HMSActionResultListener i.e. Meeting
        hmsSDK.removePeer(
          peer: peerToRemove,
          reason: "Reason to remove",
          hmsActionResultListener: this);
      }

    @override
    void onSuccess(
      {HMSActionResultListenerMethod methodType =
          HMSActionResultListenerMethod.unknown,
      Map<String, dynamic>? arguments}) {
          switch (methodType) {
          ...

          case HMSActionResultListenerMethod.removePeer:
          //Peer removed successfully
          break;  
      }        
  }


  @override
  void onException(
      {HMSActionResultListenerMethod methodType =
          HMSActionResultListenerMethod.unknown,
      Map<String, dynamic>? arguments,
      required HMSException hmsException}) {
          switch (methodType) {
          ...

          case HMSActionResultListenerMethod.removePeer:
          // Check the HMSException object for details about the error
          break;

      }
  }

}
```

### Handling the remove peer callback

The peer who is removed will receive a callback in `HMSUpdateListener` method `onRemovedFromRoom( HMSPeerRemovedFromPeer hmsPeerRemovedFromPeer)`.

The `HMSRemovedFromPeer` object which is passed into the callback has the structure:

```dart
class HMSRemovedFromPeer {
  final HMSPeer peerWhoRemoved;
  final String reason;
  final bool roomWasEnded;
}
```

`reason`: the string that the caller of `removePeerRequest` sent as the reason they were being removed from the room.

`peerWhoRemoved`: `HMSPeer` instance containing the details of the person who called `removePeerRequest`. This can be used to show the name of the person who removed them.

`roomWasEnded`: This will be false if the peer was removed. If true, it indicates that the peer was not removed, but the entire room was ended. See [End Room](/flutter/v2/features/end-room) for details.

> When this callback is received, the UI should be cleaned up from the client side. The video call room would be ended from the SDK once this callback is sent.
