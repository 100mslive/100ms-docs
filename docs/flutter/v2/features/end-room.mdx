Done with talking and it's time to end the video call room for everyone not just yourself? You may be looking to end the room.

### Permissions

Can't let just anyone end the video call room. First you need to create a [role](../foundation/templates-and-roles) with the permissions to end a room.

The permission to end a room is called `PermissionsParams.endRoom` and you should check for that within the `HMSRole` of the peer to see if they have it.

Here's how to check whether the local peer has the permission to end the room:

```dart
Future<bool> isAllowedToEndRoom() async{
    return (await hmsSDK.getLocalPeer()).role.permission?.endRoom;
}
```

`hmsSdk.getLocalPeer()` will not return null as long as you're in a preview or in a room. Since you likely won't need to check for permissions if you're not in one it would be ok.

### Ending the Room

Once you're sure the peer has the permissions to end the room, they can end it by calling `hmsSDK.endRoom(reason: "Some reason to end room", lock: false)`.

```dart
void endRoom(
      {required bool lock,
      required String reason,
      HMSActionResultListener? hmsActionResultListener}) async {}
```

`endRoom` takes the following parameters -

1. *lock*: A Boolean for whether you want to prevent anyone from rejoining the room. If false, they will be allowed to enter the room again if the client called `join`. If this is true, they will NOT able to join this room again.
2 *reason*: reason String is the text that is passed describing why the room is being ended.
3. *hmsActionResultListener*: It's the callback that would be called by SDK in case of a success or failure of `endRoom` operation

> ðŸ’¡ After calling endRoom the video calling UI should be disposed of as well since only the other peers will get the `onPeerRemoved` callback. The caller has to rely on the `onSuccess` callback for `endRoom` to decide when to terminate the meeting room UI locally.

### How to handle an end room callback for receivers

Once the peer with adequate permissions calls `endRoom`, all other peers in the room will receive a callback in `HMSUpdateListener.onRemovedFromRoom`.

The `onRemovedFromRoom` callback has a single parameter called `HMSRemovedFromRoom` with the following structure.

```dart
class HMSPeerRemovedFromRoom {
  String reason;
  bool roomWasEnded;
  HMSPeer? peerWhoRemoved;
}
```

> ðŸ’¡ This is the same callback that will be triggered if a peer was [removed from a room](/flutter/v2/features/remove-peer) as well. Except that `roomEnded` will be true when the entire room was ended.

-   _reason_: The string message detailing why the room was ended.
-   _peerWhoRemoved_: The details of the peer who called `endRoom`.
-   _roomWasEnded_: True if the entire room was ended. False if only the receiving peer was removed.

Clients should read this callback and show the appropriate UI.
