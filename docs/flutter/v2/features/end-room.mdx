Done with talking and it's time to end the video call room for everyone not just yourself? You may be looking to end the room.

## How to end room 

<div className="steps-container">

### Permissions

Can't let just anyone end the video call room. First you need to create a [role](../foundation/templates-and-roles) with the permissions to end a room.

The permission to end a room is called `PermissionsParams.endRoom` and you should check for that within the `HMSRole` of the peer to see if they have it.

Here's how to check whether the local peer has the permission to end the room:

```dart
Future<bool> isAllowedToEndRoom() async{
    return (await hmsSDK.getLocalPeer()).role.permission?.endRoom;
}
```

`hmsSdk.getLocalPeer()` will not return null as long as you're in a preview or in a room. 
Since you likely won't need to check for permissions if you're not in one it would be safe to omit null check.

### Ending the Room

Once you're sure the peer has the permissions to end the room, we can end the room by calling: 

```dart

class Meeting implements HMSActionResultListener{

    void endRoom(
      {required bool lock,
      required String reason,
      HMSActionResultListener? hmsActionResultListener}) async {
        //this is the instance of class which implements HMSActionResultListener
        hmsSDK.endRoom(
        lock: lock,
        reason:  "Some reason to end room",
        hmsActionResultListener: this);
    }

      @override
  void onSuccess(
      {HMSActionResultListenerMethod methodType =
          HMSActionResultListenerMethod.unknown,
      Map<String, dynamic>? arguments}) {

          switch (methodType) {
            case HMSActionResultListenerMethod.endRoom:
            //Room Ended successfully
            break;

            ...
        }
  }
  
  @override
  void onException(
      {HMSActionResultListenerMethod methodType =
          HMSActionResultListenerMethod.unknown,
      Map<String, dynamic>? arguments,
      required HMSException hmsException}) {

        switch (methodType) {
            case HMSActionResultListenerMethod.endRoom:
            // Check the HMSException object for details about error
            break;
            ...
        }
  
  }

}
```

\`endRoom` takes the following parameters -

1. *lock*: A Boolean for whether you want to prevent anyone from rejoining the room. If false, they will be allowed to enter the room again if the client called `join`. If this is true, they will NOT able to join this room again.
2 *reason*: reason String is the text that is passed describing why the room is being ended.
3. *hmsActionResultListener*: It's the callback that would be called by SDK in case of a success or failure of `endRoom` operation

> 💡 After calling endRoom the video calling UI should be disposed of as well since only the other peers will get the `onPeerRemoved` callback. The caller has to rely on the `onSuccess` callback for `endRoom` to decide when to terminate the meeting room UI locally.

### How to handle an end room callback for receivers

This section explains about how to handle the application if someone else ends the room.

Once the peer with adequate permissions calls `endRoom`, all other peers in the room will receive a callback in `HMSUpdateListener.onRemovedFromRoom`.

```dart 

class Meeting implements HMSUpdateListener{

    @override
    void onRemovedFromRoom({required HMSPeerRemovedFromPeer hmsPeerRemovedFromPeer}) {
    //This callback is received if someone else ends the room
    HMSPeer peerWhoEndedTheRoom = hmsPeerRemovedFromPeer.peerWhoRemoved
    //[roomWasEnded] will always be true in this case when room is ended.
    }

}

```

The `onRemovedFromRoom` callback has a single parameter called `HMSPeerRemovedFromPeer` with the following structure.

```dart
class HMSPeerRemovedFromPeer {
  String reason;
  bool roomWasEnded;
  HMSPeer? peerWhoRemoved;
}
```

> 💡 This is the same callback that will be triggered if a peer is [removed from a room](/flutter/v2/features/remove-peer) as well. Except that `roomEnded` will be true when the entire room is ended.

-   _reason_: The string message detailing why the room was ended.
-   _peerWhoRemoved_: The details of the peer who called `endRoom`.
-   _roomWasEnded_: `true` if the entire room was ended. `false` if only the receiving peer(local peer) was removed.

We can listen to this callback and show the appropriate UI.
