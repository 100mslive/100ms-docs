Flutter SDK provides support for sharing the entire screen of the device to the room.

Please note that for a peer to share their screen, their role must have screenshare enabled in the dashboard. Also select the appropriate resolution that you desire the screenshare track should be of.

## How to start screenshare from the app

To start screen share, app needs to call the `startScreenshare` method of `HMSSDK`.

Following is the snippet on how to use this:

<Tabs id="startscreenshare" items={["Dart"]} />

<Tab id='startscreenshare-0'>

```dart
hmsSDK.startScreenShare();
```

you also need to pass the intent from android native side to HMS SDK in the following way :


In your app's `MainActivity` add -

```kotlin
import live.hms.hmssdk_flutter.HmssdkFlutterPlugin
import android.app.Activity 
import android.content.Intent
import live.hms.hmssdk_flutter.Constants
```

```kotlin
override fun onActivityResult(requestCode: Int, resultCode: Int, data: Intent?) {
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)

    if (requestCode == Constants.SCREEN_SHARE_INTENT_REQUEST_CODE && resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK){
        HmssdkFlutterPlugin.hmssdkFlutterPlugin?.requestScreenShare(data)
    }
}
```

</Tab>

## How to get Screen Share Status

Application needs to call the `isScreenShareActive` method of `HMSSDK`.

This method returns a `Boolean` which will be true inscase ScreenShare is currently active and being used, and False for inactive state.

<Tabs id="screensharestatus" items={["Dart"]} />

<Tab id='screensharestatus-0'>

```dart
hmsSDK.isScreenShareActive();
```

</Tab>

## How to stop screenshare

To stop the screenshare, you need to invoke `stopscreenShare` method of `HMSSDK`

Following is the snippet on how to use this:

<Tabs id="stopscreenshare" items={["Dart"]} />

<Tab id='stopscreenshare-0'>

```dart
hmsSDK.stopScreenShare();
```

</Tab>

> DONOT forget to add the permission for foreground service in AndroidManifest.xml

```kotlin
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />
```
