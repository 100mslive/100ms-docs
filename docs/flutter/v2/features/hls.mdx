title: HLS Streaming
nav: 3.20
---

[HLS Streaming](./../foundation/live-streaming) allows for scaling to millions of viewers in near real-time. We can give a link of our
web app that will be converted to an HLS feed by our server and can be played across devices for consumption.

Behind the scenes, this will be achieved by having a bot join our room and stream what it sees and hears. Once the feed is ready, the server will give a URL that can be played using any HLS Player.

> Note that the media server serving the content in this case is owned by 100ms. If looking for a way to stream
> on YouTube, Twitch etc., please have a look at our RTMP streaming docs [here](./recording).

## Start/Stop HLS

HLS can be started in two ways depending on the level of customization we need.

1. Default View: The simplest view to just begin a stream with default UI and parameters.

2. Custom Views: To use our own UI for HLS streaming, we need to provide our web-app URL for our bot to join and stream.
                  Also, we can record the stream.

### Default View

Begins a stream with default parameters.

To start HLS with Default View, call `hmsSDK.startHlsStreaming` method.

```dart
class Meeting implements HMSUpdateListener, HMSActionResultListener{

  ...

  void startHLSStreaming(){
    ///[hmsActionResultListener]: an instance of a class that implements HMSActionResultListener
    //Here this is an instance of a class that implements HMSActionResultListener i.e. Meeting
    hmsSDK.startHlsStreaming(hmsActionResultListener: this);
  }

  void stopHLSStreaming(){
    ///[hmsActionResultListener]: an instance of a class that implements HMSActionResultListener
    //Here this is an instance of a class that implements HMSActionResultListener i.e. Meeting
    hmsSDK.stopHlsStreaming(hmsActionResultListener: this);
  }
 
  @override
  void onSuccess(
      {HMSActionResultListenerMethod methodType =
          HMSActionResultListenerMethod.unknown,
      Map<String, dynamic>? arguments}) {
          switch (methodType) {
          ...

          case HMSActionResultListenerMethod.hlsStreamingStarted:
          //HLS Started successfully
          break;  

          case HMSActionResultListenerMethod.hlsStreamingStopped:
          //HLS Stopped successfully
          break;

      }        
  }

  @override
  void onException(
      {HMSActionResultListenerMethod methodType =
          HMSActionResultListenerMethod.unknown,
      Map<String, dynamic>? arguments,
      required HMSException hmsException}) {
          switch (methodType) {
          ...

          case HMSActionResultListenerMethod.hlsStreamingStarted:
          // Check the HMSException object for details about the error
          break;

          case HMSActionResultListenerMethod.hlsStreamingStopped:
          // Check the HMSException object for details about the error
          break;

      }
  }
}
```

### Custom View

To use our own browser UI for HLS, we'll need to pass in a meeting URL. The 100ms bot will open this URL to join our room, so it must allow access without any user-level interaction.

We can call hmsSDK.startHLSStreaming with an `HMSHLSConfig` parameter.

Let's look at its structure:

```dart
// this is the HLS config class
class HMSHLSConfig {
  List<HMSHLSMeetingURLVariant>? meetingURLVariant;
  HMSHLSRecordingConfig? hmsHLSRecordingConfig;
}
```
Let's look at its attributes one by one:

#### meetingURLVariant

This is a list of `HMSHLSMeetingURLVariant` objects. In the future, it'll be possible to start HLS for multiple such URLs for the same room. So it's a list but currently, only the first element of the list is used.
The `HMSHLSMeetingURLVariant` class looks like this:

```dart
class HMSHLSMeetingURLVariant {
  String? meetingUrl;
  String metadata;
}
```

- *meetingUrl* - URL of the meeting we wish to record 
- *metadata* - Metadata(Any extra info to identify the URL) we wish to pass with the URL.

Let's look at how we can create an `HMSHLSMeetingURLVariant` and add it in meetingURLVariant :

```dart 

List<HMSHLSMeetingURLVariant>? meetingURLVariant = [];

HMSHLSMeetingURLVariant hlsUrlVariant = HMSHLSMeetingURLVariant(
          meetingUrl: "Meeting URL of the room", metadata: "HLS started from Flutter");

meetingURLVariant.add(hlsUrlVariant);

```

#### hmsHLSRecordingConfig

To record the HLS stream we may specify an `HMSHLSRecordingConfig` within the `HMSHLSConfig`.

Here's what the `HMSHlsRecordingConfig` class looks like -

```dart
class HMSHLSRecordingConfig {
  bool singleFilePerLayer;
  bool videoOnDemand;
}
```

- *singleFilePerLayer*: If the desired end result is a mp4 file per HLS layer, false by default.

- *enableVOD*: If the desired result is a zip of m3u8 and all the chunks, false by default.

Here's an example of how to create a recording config & start HLS Streaming with Recording -

```dart
HMSHLSRecordingConfig recordingConfig = HMSHLSRecordingConfig(singleFilePerLayer: false, videoOnDemand: true);
```

This can be passed in `HMSHLSConfig` to start recording.

Let's see the complete implementation of HLS streaming with recording turned ON:

```dart 
class Meeting implements HMSUpdateListener, HMSActionResultListener{

  ...

  void startHLSStreaming(String meetingUrl){

    List<HMSHLSMeetingURLVariant>? meetingURLVariant = [];
    HMSHLSMeetingURLVariant hlsUrlVariant = HMSHLSMeetingURLVariant(
              meetingUrl: meetingUrl, metadata: "HLS started from Flutter");
    meetingURLVariant.add(hlsUrlVariant);

    //This config enables recording with streaming
    HMSHLSRecordingConfig recordingConfig = HMSHLSRecordingConfig(singleFilePerLayer: false, videoOnDemand: true);

    HMSHLSConfig hlsConfig = HMSHLSConfig(
        meetingURLVariant: meetingURLVariant,
        hmsHLSRecordingConfig: hmshlsRecordingConfig);

    ///[hmshlsConfig]: an instance of HMSHLSConfig which we created above
    ///[hmsActionResultListener]: an instance of a class that implements HMSActionResultListener
    //Here this is an instance of a class that implements HMSActionResultListener i.e. Meeting
    hmsSDK.startHlsStreaming(hmshlsConfig: hlsConfig,hmsActionResultListener: this);
  }

  void stopHLSStreaming(){
    ///[hmsActionResultListener]: an instance of a class that implements HMSActionResultListener
    //Here this is an instance of a class that implements HMSActionResultListener i.e. Meeting
    hmsSDK.stopHlsStreaming(hmsActionResultListener: this);
  }
 
  @override
  void onSuccess(
      {HMSActionResultListenerMethod methodType =
          HMSActionResultListenerMethod.unknown,
      Map<String, dynamic>? arguments}) {
          switch (methodType) {
          ...

          case HMSActionResultListenerMethod.hlsStreamingStarted:
          //HLS Started successfully
          break;  

          case HMSActionResultListenerMethod.hlsStreamingStopped:
          //HLS Stopped successfully
          break;

      }        
  }

  @override
  void onException(
      {HMSActionResultListenerMethod methodType =
          HMSActionResultListenerMethod.unknown,
      Map<String, dynamic>? arguments,
      required HMSException hmsException}) {
          switch (methodType) {
          ...

          case HMSActionResultListenerMethod.hlsStreamingStarted:
          // Check the HMSException object for details about the error
          break;

          case HMSActionResultListenerMethod.hlsStreamingStopped:
          // Check the HMSException object for details about the error
          break;

      }
  }
}
```

## How to display HLS stream and get HLS state in room

The current status of the room is always reflected in the `HMSRoom` object.

Here are the relevant properties inside the `HMSRoom` object which we can read to get the current HLS streaming status of the room namely: `hlsStreamingState`.

The object contains a boolean `running` which lets us know if HLS is running in the room right now
Also, it contains the m3u8 URL which we will use to display HLS on the screen.
Just like this:

```dart 
class Meeting implements HMSUpdateListener, HMSActionResultListener{

  ...

    @override
  void onRoomUpdate({required HMSRoom room, required HMSRoomUpdate update}) {
    
     ... 

     //this contains info about whether HLS is running in the room or not
     bool isHLSRunning = room.hmshlsStreamingState?.running??false;

     //this contains the m3u8 URL if the HLS stream is running
     //This URL can be passed to the video player to display HLS Stream.
     String? hlsm3u8Url = hmshlsStreamingState?.variants[0]?.hlsStreamUrl

     ...
  }
}
```

`isHLSRunning` can be used to show the live stream status on UI something similar to this:

![hls-stream-state](/docs/v2/flutter-stream-state.jpg)

> `hlsm3u8Url` string shown above contains the m3u8 URL which can be used to display HLS Stream.

## When to check for room status

The room status should be checked in the following places -

1. In the `onJoin(room: HMSRoom)` callback of `HMSUpdateListener`
   The properties mentioned above will be on the `HMSRoom` object.
2. In the `onRoomUpdate(type: HMSRoomUpdate, hmsRoom: HMSRoom)` callback of `HMSUpdateListener`.
   The `HMSRoomUpdate` type will be `HMSRoomUpdate.HLS_STREAMING_STATE_UPDATED`.

## Key Tips

-   If using the dashboard web app from 100ms, please make sure to use a role that doesn't have publish permissions for the beam tile to not show up.
-   If using a web app, do put in place retries for API calls like tokens etc. just in case any call fails. As human users, we're used to reloading the page in these scenarios which is difficult to achieve in the automated case.
-   Make sure to not disable the logs for the passed-in meeting URL. This will allow us to have more visibility into the room, refreshing the page if joining doesn't happen within a time interval.

## Supplementary bytes

**hlsStreamingState** an instance of `HMSHLSStreamingState`, which looks like:

```dart
///[running]: bool value `true` indicates that RTMP streaming is running 
///[variants]: a list of HMSHLSVariants
class HMSHLSStreamingState(
  bool running;
  List<HMSHLSVariant?> variants;
)
```

- *variants* -> This represents a live stream to one or more HLS URLs in the container of `HMSHLSVariant`. Which looks like this:

```dart
///[hlsStreamUrl]: It contains m3u8 hlsStreamUrl which we will use to show the stream
///[meetingUrl]: URL of the room which is getting streamed
///[metadata]: Extra info about the room corresponding to meetingUrl which is passed in `HMSHLSMeetingURLVariant` while starting HLS
///[startedAt]: time at which RTMP streaming was started
class HMSHLSVariant(
  String? hlsStreamUrl;
  String? meetingUrl;
  String? metadata;
  DateTime? startedAt;
)
```
