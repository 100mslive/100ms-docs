title: Audio Output Routing
nav: 3.21
---

Audio Output Routing is helpful when users want to switch the audio output to a connected device other than the default one.

For example, you can implement an in-call speaker button that toggles audio output between the speaker, earpiece or any other connected earphones - wired or wireless, etc.

Let's see how we can use hmsSDK to implement this:

<div className="steps-container">


### Fetch Available Audio Devices

Invoke the `getAudioDevicesList` method to fetch the available audio device list. The method returns a list of `HMSAudioDevice` enum.

```dart
List<HMSAudioDevice> availableDevices = await hmsSDK.getAudioDevicesList();


enum HMSAudioDevice {
  SPEAKER_PHONE,
  EARPIECE,
  WIRED_HEADSET, // Android only
  BLUETOOTH, // Android only
  AUTOMATIC, // Android only
  UNKNOWN
}
```

The `getAudioDevicesList` API returns different values based on the Android & iOS platforms. It can return the following `HMSAudioDevice` enum values :

- For Android
* SPEAKER_PHONE   - route audio to the device speaker
* EARPIECE  - route audio to earpiece
* WIRED_HEADSET     - route audio to a connected wired device
* BLUETOOTH - route audio to connected Bluetooth device
* AUTOMATIC - automatic routing

- For iOS
* SPEAKER_PHONE   - route audio to device speaker
* EARPIECE  - route audio earpiece


### Switch Audio Focus to Another Device

Invoke the `switchAudioOutput` method with the appropriate `HMSAudioDevice` value fetched from `getAudioDevicesList` to switch the audio to that device.


The `audioDevice` is a required `HMSAudioDevice` enum type parameter which we discussed above.

```dart
///[audioDevice]: is an enum of type `HMSAudioDevice`
hmsSDK.switchAudioOutput(audioDevice: audioDevice);
```

For iOS calling, this method does the work 

For android, there are some extra steps to listen to the audio device updates in case a new device is connected or disconnected let's look at them below.

### Receive the device change updates (Android Only)

Implementing the `onAudioDeviceChanged` listener allows you to get event updates if a new audio device gets connected such as Bluetooth, Wired Headset etc. 
This method needs to be overridden in the class where `HMSUpdateListener` is implemented.

Note that this event is available only on the Android platform.

```dart 
class Meeting implements HMSUpdateListener, HMSActionResultListener{

  ...

  @override
  void onAudioDeviceChanged(
  {HMSAudioDevice? currentAudioDevice,
  List<HMSAudioDevice>? availableAudioDevice}) {
  
    // currentAudioDevice : audio device to which audio is curently being routed to
    // availableAudioDevice : all other available audio devices 
  }
}
```

</div>

## Get Current Focussed Device (Android Only)

The `getCurrentAudioDevice` method allows you to get the device through which audio output is currently being routed to.

```dart
HMSAudioDevice currentAudioDevice = await hmsSDK.getCurrentAudioDevice();
```

> Note: `onAudioDeviceChanged` listener and `getCurrentAudioDevice` methods are available only on the Android platform.
