### Getting Audio Levels for all speaking peers

```dart
import 'package:hmssdk_flutter/hmssdk_flutter.dart';

void onUpdateSpeakers({required List<HMSSpeaker> updateSpeakers}){
  // This is called every 1 second with list of active speakers
}

```

Here are the properties on the HMSSpeaker class:

1. audioLevel : int -> The level of the audio. It may vary from 0-100. A higher value indicates a higher speaking volume.
2. track : HMSTrack -> The audio track corresponding to this speaker. It may be null when the speaker who was speaking loudly, leaves.
3. peer : HMSPeer -> The peer who was speaking. This may be null if the peer has left before the update information has reached the other person.



### Active Speaker Views
To maintain an active speaker view, such as the default view in the open source advanced sample app, you need to keep track of who the active
speakers are over time. We'll be using the input from `onUpdateSpeakers` listener update as mentioned above and then building something that attempts to show all
the active speakers while minimizing re-ordering the list.



### Dominant Speaker - the loudest speaker.
The dominant speaker is the speaker who's the loudest at any given moment. There's a callback for this in the onPeerUpdate callback for HMSUpdateListener.


Here's the method signature for onPeerUpdate: `void onPeerUpdate({required HMSPeer peer, required HMSPeerUpdate update})`


When the dominant speaker has changed, there will be updates of the type:

`HMSPeerUpdate.becameDominantSpeaker` When a new person becomes the dominant speaker.

`HMSPeerUpdate.noDominantSpeaker` When the current dominant speaker stops talking and there's no one to replace them.
