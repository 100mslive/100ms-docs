title: HMSSDK Constructor
nav: 3.011
---

## Instantiate HMSSDK
Instantiate the HMSSDK like this:
```dart
HMSSDK hmsSDK = HMSSDK();
```
> In most cases, a simple `HMSSDK` constructor & calling `build` function is only required.

Following are optional parameters which are meant to be passed in the HMSSDK function for advanced use case:

- `hmsTrackSetting` : It is required to customize local peer's Audio & Video track settings. More info about this can be found [here](https://www.100ms.live/docs/flutter/v2/advanced-features/set-track-settings).
- `hmsLogSettings`: SDK sends all the logs by default. This makes debugging difficult. HMSSDK provides log levels to only receive logs which are relevant. More info about this can be found [here](https://www.100ms.live/docs/flutter/v2/features/error-handling#setting-log-levels-in-sdk).
- `appGroup`: It is only used for screen share (broadcast screen) in iOS. Refer iOS Screen share guide [here](https://www.100ms.live/docs/flutter/v2/features/screen-share#i-os-setup).
- `preferredExtension` - It is only used for screen share (broadcast screen) in iOS. Refer iOS Screen share guide [here](https://www.100ms.live/docs/flutter/v2/features/screen-share#i-os-setup)

## Sample Code with parameters

Sample code of HMSSDK with all the parameters looks like this:

1. Creating HMSTrackSetting:

Following example shows how to join meeting with muted audio and video.
```dart
// hmsAudioTrackSetting
HMSAudioTrackSetting audioTrackSetting = HMSAudioTrackSetting(
    trackInitialState: HMSTrackInitState.MUTED);
  
// hmsVideoTrackSetting
HMSVideoTrackSetting videoTrackSetting = HMSVideoTrackSetting(                                
    trackInitialState: HMSTrackInitState.MUTED);
  
// hmsTrackSetting
HMSTrackSetting trackSetting = HMSTrackSetting(
    audioTrackSetting: audioTrackSetting,
    videoTrackSetting: videoTrackSetting);
```

2. Creating HMSLogSettings:

Following example shows how to set debug level to `WARN`.
```dart
// hmsLogSettings
HMSLogSettings hmsLogSettings = HMSLogSettings(
    maxDirSizeInBytes: 1000000,
    isLogStorageEnabled: true,
    level: HMSLogLevel.WARN);
```
3. For adding preferredExtension and appGroup follow the iOS screen share guide [here](https://www.100ms.live/docs/flutter/v2/features/screen-share#i-os-setup).
After successfully following the screen share guide you can find `appGroup` and `preferredExtension` name in Xcode under `Signing and Capabilities` section under `target > yourExtensionName`.

4. Adding all the values which we have created above to HMSSDK:

```dart
HMSSDK hmsSDK = HMSSDK(
    appGroup: "appGroup",
    preferredExtension: "preferredExtension",
    hmsLogSettings: hmsLogSettings,
    hmsTrackSetting: trackSetting);
```
> Pass `appGroup` and `preferredExtension` only if you want to add screen share functionality in iOS.

## Build

The build method will create an instance of HMSSDK at native platform.

```dart
hmsSDK.build();
```

> The build function should be called after creating an instance of the HMSSDK.

## Destroy

The destroy method will delete the instance of HMSSDK at native platform.

```dart
hmsSDK.destroy();
hmsSDK = null;
```

> The destroy method should be call after `hmsSDK.leave()` method.
