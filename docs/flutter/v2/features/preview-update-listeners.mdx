title: Preview Listener
nav: 3.26

Now, let's take a look at the listener class to be implemented.

```dart
///[HMSPreviewListener] listens to updates when you preview.
///
///Just implement it and get the preview updates.
///
/// Check out the [Sample App] how we are using it.

abstract class HMSPreviewListener {
  ///when an error is caught [onError] will be called
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - error: error which you get.
  void onHMSError({required HMSException error});

  ///when you want to preview listen to this callback
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - room: the room which was joined
  ///   - localTracks: local audio/video tracks list
  void onPreview({required HMSRoom room, required List<HMSTrack> localTracks});

  /// This is called when there is a change in any property of the Room
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - room: the room which was joined
  ///   - update: the triggered update type. Should be used to perform different UI Actions
  void onRoomUpdate({required HMSRoom room, required HMSRoomUpdate update});

  /// This will be called whenever there is an update on an existing peer
  /// or a new peer got added/existing peer is removed.
  ///
  /// This callback can be used to keep a track of all the peers in the room
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - peer: the peer who joined/left or was updated
  ///   - update: the triggered update type. Should be used to perform different UI Actions
  void onPeerUpdate({required HMSPeer peer, required HMSPeerUpdate update});

  ///whenever a new audio device is plugged in or audio output is changed we
  ///get the onAudioDeviceChanged update
  ///This callback is only fired on Android devices. On iOS, this callback will not be triggered.
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - currentAudioDevice: Current audio output route
  ///   - availableAudioDevice: List of available audio output devices
  void onAudioDeviceChanged(
      {HMSAudioDevice? currentAudioDevice,
      List<HMSAudioDevice>? availableAudioDevice});
}

```

> `HMSPreviewListener` : A class conforming to HMSPreviewListener interface.
The methods of HMSPreviewListener are invoked to notify updates while in preview like a peer join,video mute/unmute, audio device selection etc.

Add this `previewListener` instance to
```dart
HMSSDK hmsSDK = new HMSSDK();
hmsSDK.build();
hmsSDK.addPreviewListener(previewListener);
```

After calling preview your app will be provided an update from the 100ms SDK.

✅ If successful, the `onPreview({required HMSRoom room, required List<HMSTrack> localTracks})` method of HMSPreviewListener will be invoked with information about the room encapsulated in the HMSRoom object.

❌ If failure, the `onHMSError({required HMSException error})` method will be invoked with exact failure reason.

Remove the `previewListener` instance as:
```dart
hmsSDK.removePreviewListener(previewListener);
```
