title: Preview Listener
nav: 3.03

The methods of HMSPreviewListener are invoked to notify updates while in preview like a peer join, video mute/unmute, audio device selection etc.

To listen to `HMSPreviewListener` methods we will need to attach a preview listener on hmsSDK.
Let's look at how we can listen to preview updates in the room:

1. Firstly we need to implement `HMSPreviewListener` in the class wherever we want the updates:

```dart 
class PreviewUpdates implements HMSPreviewListener{}
```

2. To start getting updates we will attach the previewListener as:

```dart
//hmsPreviewListener is an instance of HMSPreviewListener
//hmsSDK is HMSSDK instance on which the build is already called
hmsSDK.addPreviewListener(listener: hmsPreviewListener);
```

3. We need to override `HMSPreviewListener` methods as: 

```dart
class PreviewUpdates implements HMSPreviewListener{

  @override
  void onHMSError({required HMSException error}){}

  @override
  void onPreview({required HMSRoom room, required List<HMSTrack> localTracks}){}

  @override
  void onRoomUpdate({required HMSRoom room, required HMSRoomUpdate update}){}

  @override
  void onPeerUpdate({required HMSPeer peer, required HMSPeerUpdate update}){}

  @override
  void onAudioDeviceChanged(
      {HMSAudioDevice? currentAudioDevice,
      List<HMSAudioDevice>? availableAudioDevice}){}
}
```

After calling preview your app will be provided an update from the 100ms SDK.

✅ If successful, the `onPreview({required HMSRoom room, required List<HMSTrack> localTracks})` method of HMSPreviewListener will be invoked with information about the room encapsulated in the HMSRoom object.

❌ If failure, the `onHMSError({required HMSException error})` method will be invoked with exact failure reason.

4. To stop receiving preview updates or if we navigating from preview then we can remove the `previewListener` instance as:

```dart
hmsSDK.removePreviewListener(previewListener);
```

Now, let's take a look at the listener class in detail.

```dart
///[HMSPreviewListener] listens to updates when you preview.
///
///Just implement it and get the preview updates.
///
/// Check out the [Sample App] to know about how we are implementing it: https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-flutter.

abstract class HMSPreviewListener {
  ///when an error is caught [onError] will be called
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - error: error which you get.
  void onHMSError({required HMSException error});

  ///when you want to preview listen to this callback
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - room: the room which was joined
  ///   - localTracks: local audio/video tracks list
  void onPreview({required HMSRoom room, required List<HMSTrack> localTracks});

  /// This is called when there is a change in any property of the Room
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - room: the room which was joined
  ///   - update: the triggered update type. Should be used to perform different UI Actions
  void onRoomUpdate({required HMSRoom room, required HMSRoomUpdate update});

  /// This will be called whenever there is an update on an existing peer
  /// or a new peer got added/existing peer is removed.
  ///
  /// This callback can be used to keep a track of all the peers in the room
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - peer: the peer who joined/left or was updated
  ///   - update: the triggered update type. Should be used to perform different UI Actions
  void onPeerUpdate({required HMSPeer peer, required HMSPeerUpdate update});

  ///whenever a new audio device is plugged in or audio output is changed we
  ///get the onAudioDeviceChanged update
  ///This callback is only fired on Android devices. On iOS, this callback will not be triggered.
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - currentAudioDevice: Current audio output route
  ///   - availableAudioDevice: List of available audio output devices
  void onAudioDeviceChanged(
      {HMSAudioDevice? currentAudioDevice,
      List<HMSAudioDevice>? availableAudioDevice});
}

```
