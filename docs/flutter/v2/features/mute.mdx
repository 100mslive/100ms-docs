Mute is something that applies to both audio and video.

When you mute audio, you can't be heard by other people.

When you mute video, you will not be broadcasting your video to other people.

It can be called on local (you) or remote (other people) peer's audio or video tracks.

You get a reference to your own local peer from `getLocalPeer` on HMSSDK.

You can do the same for remote peers and HMSRemoteVideoTrack and HMSRemoteAudioTrack. Get other peers by calling `hmsSDK.getRemotePeers()`

> ðŸ’¡ You may get null for any track if the peer was not allowed to publish the track according to its role permissions.


```dart

hmsSDK.switchAudio(true);

hmsSDK.switchVideo(true);

hmsSDK.switchCamera();

hmsSDK.stopCapturing();

hmsSDK.startCapturing();
````

## Setting video and mic off while joining

Joining with muted audio/video is a customization that sets the microphone and camera state before joining the room.

By default `HMSSDK` keeps the microphone and camera on but by using this feature you can decide their state according to the use case.

To use this we need to set the `hmsVideoTrackInitState` property for video and `hmsAudioTrackInitState` in the `hmsTrackSetting`
of the `HMSSDK` constructor.

Here `trackInitialState` property of `HMSVideoTrackSetting` and `HMSAudioTrackSetting` is Enum of type `HMSTrackInitState` which has the possible values as:

```dart
enum HMSTrackInitState {

  //If the track needs to be kept mute while joining
  MUTED,

  //If the track needs to be kept unmute while joining
  UNMUTED,
}
```
#### Let's take an example to understand the implementation: 

1. For joining a room with muted audio/video these values need to be set in the `hmsTrackSetting` property as :

```dart
HMSTrackSetting trackSetting = HMSTrackSetting(
        //This is for joining with muted audio and unmuted video
        audioTrackSetting: HMSAudioTrackSetting(trackInitialState: HMSTrackInitState.MUTED),
        videoTrackSetting: HMSVideoTrackSetting(trackInitialState: HMSTrackInitState.MUTED));
```
2. While creating the `HMSSDK` object pass the `HMSTrackSetting` object created above :

```dart 
HMSSDK hmsSDK = HMSSDK(
        hmsTrackSetting: trackSetting);
```

3. Perform the other steps as usual i.e call the `build` method.

Now, the user should be able to join the room with the microphone and the camera turned off.
