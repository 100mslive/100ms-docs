Mute is something that applies to both audio and video. When you mute audio, you can't be heard by other people. When you mute a video, you will not be broadcasting your video to other people.

It can be called on local (you) or remote (other people) peer's audio or video tracks.

You get a reference to your own local peer from `getLocalPeer` on HMSSDK.

You can do the same for remote peers and HMSRemoteVideoTrack and HMSRemoteAudioTrack. Get other peers by calling `hmsSDK.getRemotePeers()`

> ðŸ’¡ You may get null for any track if the peer was not allowed to publish the track according to its role permissions.


```dart
/// To switch local peer's audio on/off.
/// Pass the bool value to [isOn] to change the current audio status
hmsSDK.switchAudio(isOn: true);


/// To switch local peer's video on/off.
/// Pass the bool value to [isOn] to change the current video status
hmsSDK.switchVideo(isOn: true);

/// Switch camera to the front or rear mode
hmsSDK.switchCamera();

## Setting video and mic off while joining

Joining with muted audio/video is a customization that sets the microphone and camera state before joining the room.

By default `HMSSDK` keeps the microphone and camera on but by using this feature you can decide their state according to the use case.

To use this we need to set the `hmsVideoTrackInitState` property for video and `hmsAudioTrackInitState` in the `hmsTrackSetting`
of the `HMSSDK` constructor.

Here `trackInitialState` property of `HMSVideoTrackSetting` and `HMSAudioTrackSetting` is Enum of type `HMSTrackInitState` which has the possible values as:

```dart
enum HMSTrackInitState {

  //If the track needs to be kept mute while joining
  MUTED,

  //If the track needs to be kept unmute while joining
  UNMUTED,
}
```
#### Let's take an example to understand the implementation: 

1. For joining a room with muted audio/video these values need to be set in the `hmsTrackSetting` property as :

```dart
HMSTrackSetting trackSetting = HMSTrackSetting(
        //This is for joining with muted audio and unmuted video
        audioTrackSetting: HMSAudioTrackSetting(trackInitialState: HMSTrackInitState.MUTED),
        videoTrackSetting: HMSVideoTrackSetting(trackInitialState: HMSTrackInitState.MUTED));
```
2. While creating the `HMSSDK` object pass the `HMSTrackSetting` object created above :

```dart 
HMSSDK hmsSDK = HMSSDK(
        hmsTrackSetting: trackSetting);
```

3. Perform the other steps as usual i.e call the `build` method.

Now, the user should be able to join the room with the microphone and the camera turned off.

## Mute Remote peers locally 

To mute peers locally `HMSSDK` provides dedicated methods `muteRoomAudioLocally` for audio and `muteRoomVideoLocally` for video. Execution 
of this method mutes audio and video for yourself others will still be able to hear audio and video.

```dart 
//To mute audio locally
hmsSDK.muteRoomAudioLocally();

//To mute video locally
hmsSDK.muteRoomVideoLocally();
```

Similarly their counterparts:

```dart
//To unmute audio locally
hmsSDK.unMuteRoomAudioLocally();

//To unmute video locally
hmsSDK.unMuteRoomVideoLocally();
```
