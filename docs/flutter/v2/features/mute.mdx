Mute is something that applies to both audio and video.

When you mute audio, you can't be heard by other people.

When you mute a video, you will not be broadcasting your video to other people.

It can be called on local (you) or remote (other people) peers' audio or video tracks.

You get a reference to your own local peer from `getLocalPeer` on HMSSDK.

You can do the same for remote peers and HMSRemoteVideoTrack and HMSRemoteAudioTrack. Get other peers by calling `hmsSDK.getRemotePeers()`

> ðŸ’¡ You may get null for any track if the peer was not allowed to publish the track according to its role permissions.


```dart

hmsSDK.switchAudio(true);

hmsSDK.switchVideo(true);

hmsSDK.switchCamera();

hmsSDK.stopCapturing();

hmsSDK.startCapturing();
