Mute is something that applies to both audio and video. When you mute audio, you can't be heard by other people i.e your audio is OFF. When you mute a video, you will not be broadcasting your video to other people i.e your video is OFF.

## Methods to mute/unmute

This example shows implementation of three methods namely : 

### 1. switchAudio : To switch local peer's audio on/off.
### 2. switchVideo : To switch local peer's video on/off.
### 3. switchCamera: Switch camera to the front or rear mode

Let's look at their implementation:

```dart
class Meeting implements HMSUpdateListener,HMSActionResultListener{

...
/// To switch local peer's audio on/off.
/// Pass the bool value to [isOn] to change the current audio status
/// [isOn] : Pass the current audio status i.e. true if unmuted and false if muted currently
hmsSDK.switchAudio(isOn: true); //This mutes local peer(you) audio


/// To switch local peer's video on/off.
/// Pass the bool value to [isOn] to change the current video status
/// [isOn] : Pass the current video status i.e. true if unmuted and false if muted currently
hmsSDK.switchVideo(isOn: true); //This mutes local peer(you) video

/// Switch camera from front or rear mode
hmsSDK.switchCamera();

...

}
```

## Mute Remote peers locally 

To mute peers all the peers for yourself `HMSSDK` provides dedicated methods `muteRoomAudioLocally` for audio and `muteRoomVideoLocally` for video. Execution 
of this method mutes audio and video only locally others will still be able to hear audio and video.

> These methods mute/unmute the room audio/video of all the peers for yourself.To mute/unmute certain peer check [this](../features/mute-unmute-remote-peer)

```dart 
//To mute room audio locally
hmsSDK.muteRoomAudioLocally();

//To mute room video locally
hmsSDK.muteRoomVideoLocally();
```

Similarly their counterparts:

```dart
//To unmute room audio locally
hmsSDK.unMuteRoomAudioLocally();

//To unmute room video locally
hmsSDK.unMuteRoomVideoLocally();
```
