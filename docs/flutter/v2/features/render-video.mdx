It all comes down to this. All the setup so far has been done so that we can show live streaming videos in our beautiful app.

To render video you will use HMSVideoView. To use it we will need a few things:

1. HMSVideoTrack: `HMSVideoView` will render video using HMSVideoTrack.
2. `HMSVideoView` will use viewSize to get the height and width of the rendered video. If not passed, it will take whatever size is available to the widget.

## How to get HMSVideoTrack 

`HMSVideoTrack` is used to render video in HMSVideoView. Single `HMSVideoView` can be attached to only one `HMSVideoTrack`.

> For resetting the track or updating any property in `HMSVideoView` it is required to use the new HMSVideoView widget.

And you can get all tracks by listening to `HMSUpdateListener.onTrackUpdate`

Add a check on these tracks to see if they are video tracks or audio tracks.

For example -

```dart
/// check if the track is video or audio

/// For Audio
track.kind == HMSTrackKind.kHMSTrackKindAudio

/// For Video
track.kind == HMSTrackKind.kHMSTrackKindVideo
```

> `HMSSDK` automatically handles audio tracks. So they are not required to be set in the application. Although [mute/unmute](../features/mute) or [set audio volume](../advanced-features/set-volume) features are provided
> by SDK.  


Now, you can pass the video track to `HMSVideoView` to get your live video on the screen.

## Render Video

To display video tracks `HMSSDK` provides the `HMSVideoView` widget.

```dart
class HMSVideoView extends StatelessWidget {
  ///  This will render video with trackId present in track
  ///[track] - track to be displayed
  final HMSVideoTrack track;

  //[matchParent] - to match the size of parent widget
  final matchParent;

  //[scaleType] - To set the video scaling
  final ScaleType scaleType;

  //[setMirror] - To set mirroring of video
  //Generally true for local peer and false for a remote peer
  final bool setMirror;

  //[isAutoSimulcast] - To set auto simulcast (Adaptive Bitrate)
  final bool isAutoSimulcast;
}
```

> `HMSVideoView` also accepts `Key` as an optional parameter but it is recommended to always pass `Key` to `HMSVideoView` So that it can be disposed of and reset correctly during rebuilds.

Let's understand the `ScaleType` property a bit more. The `ScaleType` property decides how much space the video will take from the available space.

```dart
enum ScaleType { 
  
  //Video maintains the aspect ratio so it only occupies space based on the aspect ratio
  SCALE_ASPECT_FIT, 
  
  //Video occupies all the available space and may get cropped 
  SCALE_ASPECT_FILL, 

  //Video aspect ratio is balanced similar to SCALE_ASPECT_FIT
  SCALE_ASPECT_BALANCED 
}
```

> ðŸ”‘  Note: `SCALE_ASPECT_FIT` is the default scaleType for HMSVideoView

## Dispose HMSVideoView to conserve bandwidth and cleanup elements

Remove the HMSVideoView from UI and it will not render its video & conserve network bandwidth.

It is always advised to stop rendering video when it is not required to save bandwidth consumption.
This is done in the example app by setting the `isOffscreen` property of `PeerTrackNode` as true when the peer tile is off-screen. So that app does not download the video track when the tile is off-screen.

## Limit the number of HMSVideoView on-screen at a time 

`HMSVideoView` internally uses `SurfaceView` in android and `UiKitView` in iOS. It is recommended to render at most 4-6 videos at a time on-screen and 
rest should be paginated for better performance.
