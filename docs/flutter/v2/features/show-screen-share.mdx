HMSSDK provides option to share screen from mobile phones and web browsers.The track for screenshare is of
type `HMSVideoTrack`. 

> Screenshare track can be differentiated from normal video track using track's `source` property as `track.source == "SCREEN"` for screenshare
>tracks

Screenshare tracks can be found in two ways, from `onTrackUpdate` when the track is added and other from peer's `auxiliaryTracks`.

## Screenshare track from onTrackUpdate

Get screenshare track directly from onTrackUpdate and display it as below: 

```dart
void onTrackUpdate(
      {required HMSTrack track,
      required HMSTrackUpdate trackUpdate,
      required HMSPeer peer}) {

    switch (update) {
      case HMSTrackUpdate.trackAdded:
        if (track.source == "SCREEN") {
            //This track is a screenshare track and can be rendered using HMSVideoView as
            HMSVideoView(track:track);
        }
    }
}
```

## Screenshare track from auxiliaryTracks

The peer's screenshare can also be found in `auxiliaryTracks` property of peer. `auxiliaryTracks` is of type `List<HMSTrack>?`.

To get screenshare track from `auxiliaryTracks` the implementation is as follows:

```dart
HMSTrack? screenShareTrack =
        peer.auxiliaryTracks?.firstWhere((track) => track.source == "SCREEN");
if(screenShareTrack != null){
  //The user is sharing the screen and has screenshare track.
  HMSVideoView(track: screenShareTrack);
}
```
