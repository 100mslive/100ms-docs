## Overview

This guide will walk you through simple instructions to create a video conferencing app using 100ms Flutter SDK and test it using an emulator or your mobile phone.

Please check our [basic concepts guide](./../foundation/basics) to understand the concepts like rooms, templates, peers, etc.

## Create a sample app

This section contains instructions to create a simple Flutter video conferencing app in under 10 minutes. We will help you with instructions to understand the project setup and complete code samples to implement this quickly.

Follow the instructions in one of the tabs below based on the target platform you wish to create the sample app.

### Prerequisites

To complete this implementation for Android platform, you must have:

-   An [100ms account](https://dashboard.100ms.live/register) if you don't have one already.
-   [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) `3.3.0` or higher
-   Dart `2.12.0` or above
-   [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) or any other IDE that supports Flutter. For more information on setting up an IDE, check [Flutter's official guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/editor).

### Create a Flutter app

Once you have the above prerequisites, you can follow the below steps to create a Flutter app either using terminal or using Android Studio:

-   If you wish to create a Flutter app using terminal, you can get the [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos#get-sdk) and use the below command:

    ```bash
    flutter create my_app
    ```

-   If you are using Android Studio, you can create a Flutter project from the welcome screen by clicking on `New Flutter Project` and from the menu bar, File > New > New Flutter Project.
-   Verify the `Flutter SDK path` specifies the SDK's location (select Install SDKâ€¦ if the text field is blank).
-   Enter a project name (for example, myapp). Then click Next.
-   Click Finish and wait till Android Studio creates the project.
