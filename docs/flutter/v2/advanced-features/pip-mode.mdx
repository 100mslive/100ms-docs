Sometimes we want our application to appear in a small floating window as we press the back button or navigate to home PIP comes to 
the rescue.100ms flutter SDK provides support for creating a Picture in Picture mode experience for video calls.

# For Android 

## Minimum Requirements

-   Minimum version required to support PiP is Android 8.0 (API level 26)

### How to add PiP support

1. You need to update the activity tag in the `AndroidManifest.xml`

```xml
<activity
    ....
    android:supportsPictureInPicture="true"
    android:configChanges="screenSize|smallestScreenSize|screenLayout|orientation"
    ... />
```

2. PIP mode only works above Android API Level 26(Android 8.0) but to check whether the current device supports PIP mode or not `isPipAvailable` method can be used:

```dart
hmsSDK.isPipAvailable();
```

3. To show PIP mode in the application:

```dart
hmsSDK.enterPipMode(autoEnterPip: true/false, aspectRatio: [16, 9]);
```
4. To check whether PIP mode is currently active use `isPipActive` method as:

```dart
hmsSDK.isPipActive();
```

> To display UI according to PIP use the `isPipActive` to set the state for PIP mode and render the UI accordingly.
