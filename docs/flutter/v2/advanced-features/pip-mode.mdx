nav: 4.9

100ms Flutter SDK provides support for creating Picture in Picture mode experience for video calls.

PIP Mode lets the user watch the room video in a small window pinned to a corner of the screen while navigating between apps or browsing content on the main screen.

Currently this functionality is only available on Android.

## Minimum Requirements

- Minimum version required to support PiP is Android 8.0 (API level 26)
- Minimum `hmssdk_flutter` SDK version required is 1.0.0
- To know more about PIP features minimum version requirements please check [Picture-in-picture (PiP) support](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/picture-in-picture)

### How to add PiP support

<div className="steps-container">


### Update the manifest file

You need to update the activity tag in the `AndroidManifest.xml`

```xml
<activity
    ....
    android:supportsPictureInPicture="true"
    android:configChanges="screenSize|smallestScreenSize|screenLayout|orientation"
    ... />
```

### Check PIP availablility

PIP mode only works above Android API Level 26(Android 8.0) but to check whether the current device supports PIP mode or not `isPipAvailable` method can be used:

```dart
hmsSDK.isPipAvailable();
```

### Enter PIP mode

To show PIP mode in the application:

```dart
// enterPipMode is a Future<bool> function where true indicates that the application has entered pip mode successfully.
///[autoEnterPip] if true start pip mode will start automatically when app is minimized.For android 12 and above
///[aspectRatio]: List of double indicating ratio for PIP window as [width,height]  
bool isPipEnteredSuccesfully = await hmsSDK.enterPipMode(autoEnterPip: true/false, aspectRatio: [16, 9]);
```
</div>

## How to check whether PIP is active

To check whether PIP mode is currently active use `isPipActive` method as:

```dart
hmsSDK.isPipActive();
```

> To display UI according to PIP use the `isPipActive` to set the state for PIP mode and render the UI accordingly.

### Checkout PIP in Action

How PIP mode is implemented in our example app. Checkout here:

" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.

You can checkout the 100ms Flutter SDK Github repository which also contains the PIP implementation. [Example app implementation here](https://github.com/100mslive/100ms-flutter/tree/main/example).
