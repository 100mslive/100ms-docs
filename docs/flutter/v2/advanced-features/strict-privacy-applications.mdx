Strict Privacy Applications are those applications which ask for permissions as & when required thus following something
similar to principle of least privilege.

## Steps to create a strict privacy application:

1. Join in a role without video permissions.

Create three roles with permissions as:

- Host 

![host](/docs/v2/flutter-host.png)

- Guest

![guest](/docs/v2/flutter-guest.png)

- Viewer

![viewer](/docs/v2/flutter-viewer.png)

> These roles are just for examples. User can create their own roles based on use cases.

2. If role of user is changed to a role which has audio-video publishing permission then ask for permissions as:

```dart
@override
void onRoleChangeRequest({required HMSRoleChangeRequest roleChangeRequest}) {
    if(roleChangeRequest.suggestedRole.publishSettings?.allowed.contains("video")??false){
        //if video permissions are not available
        await Permission.camera.request();
    }
    if(roleChangeRequest.suggestedRole.publishSettings?.allowed.contains("audio")??false){
        //if audio permissions are not available
        await Permission.microphone.request();
        //if bluetooth permissions are not available
        await Permission.bluetoothConnect.request();
    }

    //if the application have required permissions
    hmsSDK.acceptChangeRole(roleChangeRequest);
}
```

> This is applicable only when user asks for permission while changing role. In case of force role change
> the application is required to have permissions before the role change.
