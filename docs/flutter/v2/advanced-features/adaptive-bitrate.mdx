title: Adaptive Bitrate (Simulcast)
nav: 5.0
---


Simulcast enables [Adaptive Bitrate](../foundation/adaptive-bitrate) (ABR) in video conferencing scenarios. This means 100ms SDKs can upgrade or downgrade video quality for remote tracks based on user preferences or network conditions.

## Minimum Requirements

-   SDK version 1.2.0 or higher
-   Simulcast enabled in room template

## 100ms SDK Simulcast APIs

You interact with the simulcast feature by setting `HMSRemoteVideoTrack`'s `setSimulcastLayer` function. By default the layer is set to high i.e `HMSSimulcastLayer.high` Let's look at the track interface:

```dart
class HMSRemoteVideoTrack {

/**
   * Public api to set simulcast layer to [HMSSimulcastLayer.high], [HMSSimulcastLayer.low], [HMSSimulcastLayer.mid]
   */
  Future<HMSException?> setSimulcastLayer(HMSSimulcastLayer layer)

	/**
   * Public API to get simulcast layers definition
   */
  Future<List<HMSSimulcastLayerDefinition>> getLayerDefinition()

	/**
   * Public API to get the current selected HMSSimulcastLayer
   */
  Future<HMSSimulcastLayer> getLayer()

}

class HMSSimulcastLayerDefinition(
  HMSSimulcastLayer hmsSimulcastLayer;
  HMSResolution hmsResolution;
)

enum HMSSimulcastLayer 
{ 
    high, mid, low 
}
``` 

Here `getLayerDefinition()` property holds an array of currently available layers for the track and `getLayer()` property is the currently selected layer. Within `HMSSimulcastLayerDefinition` you get its resolution and the layer name such as high/mid/low.

## Disabling Auto Simulcast

You can read more about it [here](../features/render-video#4-disableautosimulcastlayerselect)

## Implementation

### Get Current layer

Here's how to get the current layer of remote video track:

```dart
  HMSRemoteVideoTrack remoteTrack; // get remote track from the onTrackUpdate.
  HMSSimulcastLayer currentLayer = remoteTrack.getLayer();
```

### Get All available layers

Here's how to get the all available layers with their resolution:

```dart
  HMSRemoteVideoTrack remoteTrack; // get remote track from the onTrackUpdate.
  List<HMSSimulcastLayerDefinition> availableLayers = remoteTrack.getLayerDefinition();
```

### change Layer manually

If you want to can change layer manually then follow the follwing steps:

```dart
  HMSRemoteVideoTrack remoteTrack;
  List<HMSSimulcastLayerDefinition> availableLayers = remoteTrack.getLayerDefinition();
  // availableLayers will contains all the layers which remote peer is publishing.
  // In this example we are taking first layer in availableLayers list.
  HMSSimulcastLayer firstLayer = availableLayers[0].hmsSimulcastLayer;
  // set layer by passing it to `setSimulcastLayer` function.
  remoteTrack.setSimulcastLayer(firstLayer);
```
