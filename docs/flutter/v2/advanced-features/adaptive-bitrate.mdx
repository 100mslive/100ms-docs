title: Adaptive Bitrate (Simulcast)
nav: 5.0
---


Simulcast enables [Adaptive Bitrate](../foundation/adaptive-bitrate) (ABR) in video conferencing scenarios. This means 100ms SDKs can upgrade or downgrade video quality for remote tracks based on user preferences or network conditions.

## Minimum Requirements

-   SDK version 1.2.0 or higher
-   Simulcast enabled in room template

## 100ms SDK Simulcast APIs

You interact with the simulcast feature by setting `HMSRemoteVideoTrack`'s `setSimulcastLayer` function. By default the layer is set to high i.e `HMSSimulcastLayer.high` Let's look at the track interface:

```dart
class HMSRemoteVideoTrack {

/**
   * Public api to set simulcast layer to [`HMSSimulcastLayer.high], [`HMSSimulcastLayer.low], [`HMSSimulcastLayer.mid]
   */
  Future<HMSException?> setSimulcastLayer(HMSSimulcastLayer layer)

	/**
   * Public API to get simulcast layers definition
   */
  Future<List<HMSSimulcastLayerDefinition>> getLayerDefinition()

	/**
   * Public API to get the current selected HMSSimulcastLayer
   */
  Future<HMSSimulcastLayer> getLayer()

}

data class HMSSimulcastLayerDefinition(
  HMSSimulcastLayer hmsSimulcastLayer;
  HMSResolution hmsResolution;
)

enum HMSSimulcastLayer 
{ 
    high, mid, low 
}
```

Here `getLayerDefinition()` property holds an array of currently available layers for the track and `getLayer()` property is the currently selected layer. Within `HMSSimulcastLayerDefinition` you get its resolution and the layer name such as high/mid/low.
