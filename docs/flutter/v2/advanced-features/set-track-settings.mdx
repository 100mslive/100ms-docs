title: Set Track Settings
nav: 4.01

Sometimes it is required to customize local peer's Audio & Video track settings while creating instances of 100ms SDK.

These settings are optional parameters and are meant to be passed in the `HMSSDK` function as the `hmsTrackSetting` parameter which is an `HMSTrackSettings` object.

### For the Audio track we can set the following properties :

- `useHardwareAcousticEchoCanceler` - Property to enable Hardware echo cancellation. By default, it's set to `true` if the device supports it.
  Please note that on some devices the hardware wrongly reports the HW echo canceler to be present whereas it does not work
  In such cases, the application needs to set this to `false`, so that SW echo canceler is picked up
- `audioSource` - Property to configure audio nodes mainly used in iOS for audio sharing.
- `trackInitialState` - Property to set the initial state of the audio track i.e Mute/Unmute.More info about this can be found [here](../features/join-with-muted-audio-video)

## For the Video track we can set the following properties : 

- `cameraFacing` - Property specifies which camera to open while joining. It can be toggled later on. The default value is `HMSCameraFacing.FRONT`.

```dart
HMSCameraFacing.FRONT
HMSCameraFacing.BACK
```

- `disableAutoResize` - Property to disable auto-resizing.
- `trackInitialState` - Property to set the initial state of the video track i.e Mute/Unmute.More info about this can be found [here](../features/join-with-muted-audio-video)

## How to add track settings while initializing HMSSDK 

Here's a sample implementation of adding track settings while initializing 100ms SDK -

```dart
  HMSAudioTrackSetting audioTrackSetting = HMSAudioTrackSetting(
    useHardwareAcousticEchoCanceler: false,
    trackInitialState: HMSTrackInitState.UNMUTED
  );
  
  HMSVideoTrackSetting videoTrackSetting = HMSVideoTrackSetting(                                
    cameraFacing: HMSCameraFacing.FRONT,
    trackInitialState: HMSTrackInitState.UNMUTED
  );
  
HMSTrackSettings trackSettings = HMSTrackSetting(
      audioTrackSetting: audioTrackSetting,
      videoTrackSetting: videoTrackSetting
    );

HMSSDK hmsSDK = HMSSDK(hmsTrackSetting: trackSettings);
```

You can fetch the track Settings using the method after the build method is called as follows - 
```dart
HMSTrackSettings trackSettings = hmsSDK.getTrackSettings();
```
