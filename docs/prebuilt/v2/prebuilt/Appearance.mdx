## Changing Logo

You can easily replace the default logo that appears on the Prebuilt interface with your own logo. To do this, click on "Logo" input field and upload your custom logo image.

## Switching Between Dark and Light Themes

Prebuilt offers two distinct themes for your app: a dark theme and a light theme. You can choose the one that best suits your appâ€™s aesthetics.

Once you toggle the theme switch to select either the dark or light theme, your Prebuilt app will be displayed with the selected theme.

Selecting between a dark or light theme is crucial for setting the fundamental visual structure of your app. While the choice may appear limited with just two themes, these themes form the canvas on which your color tokens are applied. This ensures a unified and harmonious design, aligning with your brand and elevating the overall user experience.

<Note title="Switching themes">
If you change the theme type, your color customizations will be reset. Be sure to reconfigure your color settings under Color Tokens section after switching between the dark and light themes to maintain your desired appearance.

## Color Tokens

Color Tokens allow you to customize various color aspects of the Prebuilt user interface, ensuring consistency with your brand or app's design. To customize any of the colors, adjust the color values for each color variant according to your preferences. You can input a hex code, enter RGB values or select from the color picker. Click the `Save` button to apply the changes. 

<Note title ="Modifying color tokens">
You only need to modify the default color value; the other color roles are automatically generated to maintain a consistent color scheme. For example, changing Primary color value generates Primary Default, Bright, Dim and Disabled.
