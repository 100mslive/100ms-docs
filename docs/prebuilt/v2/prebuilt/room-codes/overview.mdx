A Room Code is a unique encrypted short code generated by 100ms for a given Role and Room. A Room Code represents a unique `role` and `room_id` combination.


## Why use Room Codes?

Essentially, Room Codes allow you to create unique Room Links and Room Code Authentication mechanism for every Role in a Room.

## Room Codes Basics

- Room codes are 10 digit short codes and follow a standard format - `***-****-***`
- Room codes require a Template, a Room and at least one Role to be created.

### Room Code Lifecycle

A Room Code is a binary state entity represented by **enabled: true | false**.
    - `enabled:true` represents an enabled Room Code. Effectively, Room links and Room Code Authentication work with only enabled Room Codes.
    - `enabled:false` represents a disabled Room Code. Room links and Room Code Authentication does not work with disabled Room Codes.

You can get the state of a Room Code `enable:true|false` using **[Get Room Code API](/server-side/v2/api-reference/room-codes/get-room-code-api).** Always make sure that this flag is enabled before creating Room Links or performing a peer join using Room Code Authentication.

You can manage the state of a Room Code for a Role and make it enabled/disabled using **[Update Room Code API](/server-side/v2/api-reference/room-codes/update-room-code-api)**
    
### Room Codes do not expire

Room Codes do not have an expiry, thus, you can reuse Room Codes infinitely. This enables “fixed Room Links” that can be reused / re-shared or allocated to your end users. No need to generate new Room Links for every Session for a given `room_id`. However, if your use case requires "fresh Room Links" and discard old links, you should first disable the intended Room Codes and then generate new Room Codes for a role using [Create Room Code API](/server-side/v2/api-reference/room-codes/create-room-code-api) or [Create Role Room Code API.](/server-side/v2/api-reference/room-codes/create-room-code-api#2-create-role-room-code-api)

### Creating Room Codes

For Rooms created on [100ms dashboard](https://dashboard.100ms.live/dashboard), a room code gets generated for every role in the room by default.

If you're using [Create Room API](/server-side/v2/api-reference/Rooms/create-via-api) to create Rooms, you need to explicitly create room codes for every role in the Room. Refer [Create Room Codes API](/server-side/v2/api-reference/room-codes/create-room-code-api). This API allows you to create room code for
        - every role in the room at once  using [Create Room Code API](/server-side/v2/api-reference/room-codes/create-room-code-api#1-create-a-room-code-api) 
        - a specific role in the room using [Create Role Room Code API](server-side/v2/api-reference/room-codes/create-room-code-api#2-create-role-room-code-api)

</Tab>

### Multiple Room Codes per role

100ms also supports multiple Room Codes per Role (up to 100 Room Codes per Room). This means that each user for a given role can be associated with a unique Room Code, and thus allow you to created unique room links for each user and unique Room Code based authentication. Please handle the logic to map Room Codes on user level at your end as we support Room Code creation only on Role and not Peer level.
